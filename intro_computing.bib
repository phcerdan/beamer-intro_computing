	abstract = {This study describes the viscoelastic properties of a refined cellular-tensegrity model composed of six rigid bars connected to a continuous network of 24 viscoelastic pre-stretched cables (Voigt bodies) in order to analyse the role of the cytoskeleton spatial rearrangement on the viscoelastic response of living adherent cells. This structural contribution was determined from the relationships between the global viscoelastic properties of the tensegrity model, i.e., normalized viscosity modulus (η*), normalized elasticity modulus (E*), and the physical properties of the constitutive elements, i.e., their normalized length (L*) and normalized initial internal tension (T*). We used a numerical method to simulate the deformation of the structure in response to different types of loading, while varying by several orders of magnitude L* and T*. The numerical results obtained reveal that η* remains almost independent of changes in T* (η*∝T*+0.1), whereas E* increases with approximately the square root of the internal tension T* (from E*∝T*+0.3 to E*∝T*+0.7). Moreover, structural viscosity η* and elasticity E* are both inversely proportional to the square of the size of the structure (η*∝L*−2 and E*∝L*−2). These structural properties appear consistent with cytoskeleton (CSK) mechanical properties measured experimentally by various methods which are specific to the CSK micromanipulation in living adherent cells. Present results suggest, for the first time, that the effect of structural rearrangement of CSK elements on global CSK behavior is characterized by a faster cellular mechanical response relatively to the CSK element response, which thus contributes to the solidification process observed in adherent cells. In extending to the viscoelastic properties the analysis of the mechanical response of the cellular 30-element tensegrity model, the present study contributes to the understanding of recent results on the cellular-dynamic response and allows to reunify the scattered data reported for the viscoelastic properties of living adherent cells.},

In this study, we show that the macroscopic network response of reconstituted actin networks can be traced back to the microscopic interaction potential of an individual actin/ABP bond. The viscoelastic response of cross-linked actin networks is set by the cross-linker off-rate, the binding energy, and the characteristic bond length of individual actin/ABP interactions.},

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure consisting of the deployment and fixation of a stent–graft that isolates the damaged vessel wall from blood circulation. The technique requires adequate endovascular device sizing, which may be performed by vascular analysis and quantification on Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) scans. This paper presents a novel 3D CTA image-based software for AAA inspection and EVAR sizing, eVida Vascular, which allows fast and accurate 3D endograft sizing for standard and fenestrated endografts. We provide a description of the system and its innovations, including the underlying vascular image analysis and visualization technology, functional modules and user interaction. Furthermore, an experimental validation of the tool is described, assessing the degree of agreement with a commercial, clinically validated software, when comparing measurements obtained for standard endograft sizing in a group of 14 patients.},

MD can very well simulate the atomistic behavior, but cannot simulate macroscale length and time due to computational limits. FE can very well simulate continuum mechanics (CM) problems, but has the limitation of the lack of atomistic level degrees of freedom. Multiscale modeling is an expedient methodology with a potential to connect different levels of modeling such as quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and continuum mechanics. This study proposes a new multiscale modeling technique to couple MD with FE. The proposed method relies on weighted average momentum principle. A wave propagation example has been used to illustrate the challenges in coupling MD with FE and to verify the proposed technique. Furthermore, 2-Dimensional problem has also been used to demonstrate how this method would translate into real world applications.},

The Tevatron data strongly suggests that one-loop computations in QCD describe hard scattering well. Extrapolating this observation to the LHC, we conclude that knowledge of many short-distance processes at next-to-leading order may be required to describe the physics of hard scattering. While the field of one-loop computations is quite mature, parton multiplicities in hard LHC events are so high that traditional computational techniques become inefficient. Recently new approaches based on unitarity have been developed for calculating one-loop scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. These methods are especially suitable for the description of multi-particle processes in QCD and are amenable to numerical implementations. We present a systematic pedagogical description of both conceptual and technical aspects of the new methods.},

Fractal analysis based on the spectral dimension is used, for the first time, to characterise fibrin gel microstructure in terms of the internal connectivity of gel networks. A significant correlation is found between the fractal characteristics of the incipient gel network and its eventual mature form, confirming that incipient gel microstructure templates ensuing gel development. We report an analytical basis for the study of this templating effect which reveals two different regimes of microstructural development. The first involves low thrombin concentration, in which increasing concentration decreases the gel formation time and alters the fractal characteristics of both incipient and mature gels. In the second regime, involving higher thrombin concentrations, the incipient gel formation time and the fractal characteristics of incipient and mature gels show little variation. The network formation is discussed in terms of computer simulations of incipient fractal networks by the activation-limited aggregation of clusters of rod-like particles. The significance of the work is discussed in terms of biomaterials design for applications involving controlled drug release and wound healing, and improved predictions of blood clot susceptibility to lysis.},

We combine a smooth vessel filter which is based on a geometrical analysis of the Hessian’s eigensystem, with a non-linear anisotropic diffusion scheme. The amount and orientation of diffusion depend on the local vessel likeliness. Vessel enhancing diffusion (VED) is applied to patient and phantom data and compared to linear, regularized Perona–Malik, edge and coherence enhancing diffusion. The method performs better than most of the existing techniques in visualizing vessels with varying radii and in enhancing vessel appearance. A diameter study on phantom data shows that VED least affects the accuracy of diameter measurements. It is shown that using VED as a preprocessing step improves level set based segmentation of the cerebral vasculature, in particular segmentation of the smaller vessels of the vasculature.},

If there is a second sample, y1,⋯,yMy\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, y\_M, a test of the hypothesis that the two samples come from the same (unspecified) continuous distribution can be based on the analogue of Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2, namely T=[NM/(N+M)]∫∞−∞[FN(x)−GM(x)]2dHN+M(x),(2){\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\}{\textbackslash}tag\{2\} T = {\textbackslash}lbrack NM/(N + M){\textbackslash}rbrack {\textbackslash}int{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}infty\_\{-{\textbackslash}infty\} {\textbackslash}lbrack F\_N(x) - G\_M(x){\textbackslash}rbrack{\textasciicircum}2 dH\_\{N+M\}(x),{\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} where GM(x)G\_M(x) is the empirical distribution function of the second sample and HN+M(x)H\_\{N+M\}(x) is the empirical distribution function of the two samples together [that is, (N+M)HN+M(x)=NFN(x)+MGM(x)](N + M)H\_\{N+M\}(x) = NF\_N(x) + MG\_M(x){\textbackslash}rbrack. The limiting distribution of Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2 as N→∞N {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty has been tabulated [2], and it has been shown ([3], [4a], and [7]) that TT has the same limiting distribution as N→∞,M→∞N {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty, M {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty, and N/M→λN/M {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}lambda, where λ{\textbackslash}lambda is any finite positive constant. In this note we consider the distribution of TT for small values of NN and MM and present tables to permit use of the criterion at some conventional significance levels for small values of NN and MM. The limiting distribution seems a surprisingly good approximation to the exact distribution for moderate sample sizes (corresponding to the same feature for Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2 [6]). The accuracy of approximation is better than in the case of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic studied by Hodges [4].},

	abstract = {In an earlier paper written for a different readership [Computers and Graphics 13(2) (1989) 159–166] the first author defined a digital fundamental group—an analog, for binary digital pictures, of the fundamental group. In general the definition of the digital fundamental group involves continuous deformation. But an alternative, discrete, definition of the digital fundamental group was proposed for the strongly normal digital picture spaces defined in the same paper. The above-mentioned paper also defined a “continuous analog” C(P) for each binary digital picture P on such a DPS (DPS=digital picture space). C(P) is a polyhedron constructed by “filling in the gaps” between black points (1's) of the binary digital picture P in a specific way. Other kinds of continuous analog had previously been used by the first two authors. In seeking the simplest and most efficient algorithms for performing image processing operations, researchers have considered many different combinations of grids and adjacency relations. Almost all of those combinations are isomorphic to special cases of the concept of a strongly normal DPS. The main contribution of the present paper is a proof that the digital fundamental groups of binary digital pictures on a strongly normal DPS are naturally isomorphic to the fundamental groups of the digital pictures' continuous analogs. We use this result to establish that on a strongly normal DPS the discrete and continuous definitions of the digital fundamental group are equivalent, up to a natural group isomorphism. We also show that many topological results which hold in the Euclidean plane or Euclidean 3-space have analogs that hold in every strongly normal DPS. Our results suggest that a strongly normal DPS is a suitable domain for studying topology-related image processing operations such as thinning, border tracking and contour filling. The definitions of digital fundamental group, strongly normal DPS and continuous analog are included in this paper so as to make it self-contained.},

The mechanical stiffness can vary by several decades with small changes in cross-link concentration, and can increase markedly upon application of external stress.

	abstract = {In an attempt to understand the role of structural rearrangement onto the cell response during imposed cyclic stresses, we simulated numerically the frequency-dependent behavior of a viscoelastic tensegrity structure (VTS model) made of 24 elastic cables and 6 rigid bars. The VTS computational model was based on the nonsmooth contact dynamics (NSCD) method in which the constitutive elements of the tensegrity structure are considered as a set of material points that mutually interact. Low amplitude oscillatory loading conditions were applied and the frequency response of the overall structure was studied in terms of frequency dependence of mechanical properties. The latter were normalized by the homogeneous properties of constitutive elements in order to capture the essential feature of spatial rearrangement. The results reveal a specific frequency-dependent contribution of elastic and viscous effects which is responsible for significant changes in the VTS model dynamical properties. The mechanism behind is related to the variable contribution of spatial rearrangement of VTS elements which is decreased from low to high frequency as dominant effects are transferred from mainly elastic to mainly viscous. More precisely, the elasticity modulus increases with frequency while the viscosity modulus decreases, each evolution corresponding to a specific power-law dependency. The satisfactorily agreement found between present numerical results and the literature data issued from in vitro cell experiments suggests that the frequency-dependent mechanism of spatial rearrangement presently described could play a significant and predictable role during oscillatory cell dynamics.},

This is achieved by sequentially deleting points in ascending distance order until no more can be safely deleted. A point can be safely deleted only if doing so preserves topology. Distance information is provided by the chamfer distance transform, an integer approximation to the Euclidean distance transform. Two variations of DOHT are presented that arise from using different rules for preserving points. The first uses explicit rules for preserving the ends of medial axes or edges of medial surfaces, and the second preserves the centers of maximal balls identified from the chamfer distance transform. By thresholding the centers according to their distance values, the user can control the scale of features represented in the skeleton. Results are presented for real and synthetic 2D and 3D data.},

By investigating the effect of the body on the overall control computation, it has been suggested that the body is effectively performing computations, leading to the term morphological computation. Recent work has linked this to the field of reservoir computing, allowing one to endow morphologies with a theory of universal computation. In this work, we study a family of highly dynamic body structures, called tensegrity structures, controlled by one of the simplest kinds of "brains." These structures can be used to model biomechanical systems at different scales. By analyzing this extreme instantiation of compliant structures, we demonstrate the existence of a spectrum of choices of how to implement control in the body-brain composite. We show that tensegrity structures can maintain complex gaits with linear feedback control and that external feedback can intrinsically be integrated in the control loop. The various linear learning rules we consider differ in biological plausibility, and no specific assumptions are made on how to implement the feedback in a physical system.},

The simulation also allows studying the presence and evolution of multiradicals along the polymerization.},

	abstract = {This white paper is an explanation of Ben and Dave's TARDIS time machine, written for laypeople who are interested in time travel, but have no technical knowledge of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. The first part of this paper is an introduction to the pertinent ideas from Einstein's theory of curved spacetime, followed by a review of other popular time machine spacetimes. We begin with an introduction to curvature and lightcones. We then explain the Alcubierre Warp Drive, the Morris-Thorne wormhole, and the Tipler cylinder. We then describe the Traversable Achronal Retrograde Domain in Spacetime (TARDIS), and explain some of its general properties. Our TARDIS is a bubble of spacetime curvature which travels along a closed loop in space and time. A person travelling within the bubble will feel a constant acceleration. A person outside of the TARDIS will see two bubbles: one which is evolving forwards in time, and one which is evolving backwards in time. We then discuss the physical limitations which may prevent us from ever constructing a TARDIS. Finally, we discuss the method through which a TARDIS can be used to travel between arbitrary points in space and time, and the possible dangers involved with exiting a TARDIS from the wrong side.

We also briefly discuss the network aspects of cytoskeletal tensegrity. Finally, we show the importance of the balance between functional flexibility and rigidity in protein–protein interaction, metabolic, gene regulatory and neuronal networks. Our summary raises the possibility that the concepts of flexibility and rigidity can be generalized to all networks.},

	abstract = {The influence of the microstructures of different ?-carrageenan gels on the self-diffusion behavior of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the diffusion behavior was determined mainly by the void size, which in turn was defined by the state of aggregation of the ?-carrageenan. The ?-carrageenan concentration was held constant at 1 w/w\%, and the aggregation was controlled by the amount of potassium and/or sodium chloride and, for samples containing potassium, also by the cooling rate. Gels containing potassium formed microstructures where ?-carrageenan strands are rather evenly distributed over the image size, while sodium gels formed dense biopolymer clusters interspersed with large openings. In a gel with small void sizes, relatively slow diffusion was found for all PEG sizes investigated. Extended studies of the self-diffusion behavior of the 634 g mol-1 PEG showed that there is a strong time dependence in the measured PEG diffusion. An asymptotic lower time limit of the diffusion coefficient was found in all gels when the diffusion observation time was increased. According to the ratio, D/D0, where D0 is the diffusion coefficient in D2O and D is the diffusion coefficient in the gels, the gels could be divided into three classes:? small, medium, and large voids. For quenched ?-carrageenan solutions with salt concentrations of 20 mM K+, 100 mM K+, or 20 mM K+/200 mM Na+ as well as slowly cooled solutions with only 20 mM K+, D/D0 ratios between 0.18 and 0.29 were obtained. By quenching a ?-carrageenan solution with 100 mM K+, the D/D0 was 0.5, while D/D0 ratios between 0.9 and 1 were obtained in a quenched solution with 250 mM Na+ and slowly cooled samples with 20 mM K+/200 mM Na+ or 250 mM Na+.},

The extracellular matrix receptor, integrin beta 1, induced focal adhesion formation and supported a force-dependent stiffening response, whereas nonadhesion receptors did not. The cytoskeletal stiffness (ratio of stress to strain) increased in direct proportion to the applied stress and required intact microtubules and intermediate filaments as well as microfilaments. Tensegrity models that incorporate mechanically interdependent struts and strings that reorient globally in response to a localized stress mimicked this response. These results suggest that integrins act as mechanoreceptors and transmit mechanical signals to the cytoskeleton. Mechanotransduction, in turn, may be mediated simultaneously at multiple locations inside the cell through force-induced rearrangements within a tensionally integrated cytoskeleton.},

	abstract = {Dynamic oscillatory shear tests are common in rheology and have been used to investigate a wide range of soft matter and complex fluids including polymer melts and solutions, block copolymers, biological macromolecules, polyelectrolytes, surfactants, suspensions, emulsions and beyond. More specifically, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) tests have become the canonical method for probing the linear viscoelastic properties of these complex fluids because of the firm theoretical background [1–4] and the ease of implementing suitable test protocols. However, in most processing operations the deformations can be large and rapid: it is therefore the nonlinear material properties that control the system response. A full sample characterization thus requires well-defined nonlinear test protocols. Consequently there has been a recent renewal of interest in exploiting large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) tests to investigate and quantify the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of complex fluids. In terms of the experimental input, both LAOS and SAOS require the user to select appropriate ranges of strain amplitude (γ0) and frequency (ω). However, there is a distinct difference in the analysis of experimental output, i.e. the material response. At sufficiently large strain amplitude, the material response will become nonlinear in LAOS tests and the familiar material functions used to quantify the linear behavior in SAOS tests are no longer sufficient. For example, the definitions of the linear viscoelastic moduli G′(ω) and G″(ω) are based inherently on the assumption that the stress response is purely sinusoidal (linear). However, a nonlinear stress response is not a perfect sinusoid and therefore the viscoelastic moduli are not uniquely defined; other methods are needed for quantifying the nonlinear material response under LAOS deformation. In the present review article, we first summarize the typical nonlinear responses observed with complex fluids under LAOS deformations. We then introduce and critically compare several methods that quantify the nonlinear oscillatory stress response. We illustrate the utility and sensitivity of these protocols by investigating the nonlinear response of various complex fluids over a wide range of frequency and amplitude of deformation, and show that LAOS characterization is a rigorous test for rheological models and advanced quality control.},

Alternative explanation of stiffening in cross-linked semiflexible networks. Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 178102]. These simulations make use of a geometrically nonlinear finite-element technique, taking into account the discreteness of the biopolymer network. As an alternative to the prevalent view, these computations relate the stiffening to nonaffine network reorientations. However, this discrete-network model neglects any interaction of the filaments with the surrounding fluid, which is the origin of entropic stiffening in single filaments and in biopolymer networks, according to MacKintosh et al. For this reason, this article is devoted to a thorough study of the difference between both approaches on the 2D single-filament level. In addition, we investigate the deviation from affine deformation behavior, by comparing the discrete calculations with an affine-network model.},

Turbidity measurements were employed for the determination of average fiber diameter. Self-similar structure of the gel network was found to be realized in the range between those two scales. The fibrin gels formed by larger amounts of thrombin showed a smaller fractal dimension that, deduced by the box-counting method, was in good agreement with the result from 3-d FT analysis and with a recent dynamic light scattering study (Kita R. et al.

Clustering of integrins is known to mediate signaling through a variety of signal transduction pathways. Yet, the molecular mechanisms of integrin clustering are poorly understood. In this paper, we develop computational models, using agent based modeling (ABM) techniques, to explore two key underlying mechanisms of integrin clustering, namely ligand organization and integrin homo-oligomerization. Our models help to shed light on the potential roles ligand clustering and integrin homo-oligomerization may play in controlling integrin clustering. A potential mechanism for the clustering of integrin is discussed and the effects of other parameters such as integrin–ligand affinity, membrane crowdedness and ligand mobility on integrin clustering are examined.},

A nested solution technique enables the mutual transfer of information between global and local scales which are solved simultaneously in a finite element analysis. Therefore, apart from improving the coarse-scale solution by considering fine-scale features, a detailed simulation of the micro-level also enables the determination of local fine-scale quantities of interest. To account for transient effects, a dynamic simulation on the macro-scale is locally coupled to a quasi-static simulation of the discretized micro-level. For time integration, the generalized-α scheme is employed on both scales. The presented algorithm is applicable for large deformations, rotations and arbitrary micro-structural behavior. On the macro-level, no constitutive assumption is required since the stress–strain relationship is directly computed from the micro-scale using established computational homogenization procedures. First simulations validate the novel approach and demonstrate its suitability for lung parenchyma considering complex surfactant film dynamics as an example of fine-scale multi-physics.},

	abstract = {The results of microrheological studies carried out on ionotropic pectin gels, particularly the manifest power law behavior observed at high frequencies, indicate that by using different assembly conditions gels can be formed in which the elementary network strands have different stiffnesses. It has been hypothesized that these differences reflect different network architectures, the extreme cases of which might be described as (i) dimeric calcium-chelating junction-zones of limited extent, linked by considerably longer, flexible, single-chain sections, or (ii) semiflexible bundles consisting of extensively aggregated dimeric junction zones that latterly become entangled and cross-linked. To test this hypothesis directly, microrheologically distinct pectin gels have been generated using different assembly modalities, in particular by using different concentrations of polymer and cross-linking ions and by contrasting the controlled-release of ions or ion-binding groups, and the resulting systems have been studied by small-angle X-ray scattering. The results straightforwardly reveal that gels that are clearly more semiflexible from a microrheological point-of-view contain larger scattering entities than those with a more flexible character. Furthermore, a more detailed interpretation of the scattering data with the aid of molecular modeling suggests that for the gels formed here those with a semiflexible microrheological signature consist predominantly of network filaments consisting of four or more chains, whereas those with a more flexible signature are predominantly single-chain sections linked by dimeric associations with no more that a few percent of the chains bundled to any higher extent. The ability to generate differing network architectures from the same polymer that fulfill different functional requirements, either in vivo in the plant cell wall, where pectin plays a crucial structural and mechanical role, or in vitro in a myriad of applications, makes these biomimetic biopolymer networks of considerable interest.},

The quenched average of the free energy turns out to be subadditive with respect to the size of the system. This gives immediately convergence of the free energy per site, in the infinite volume limit. Moreover, a simple argument, based on concentration of measure, gives the almost sure convergence, with respect to the external noise.

	abstract = {The tethering of platelets on the injured vessel surface mediated by glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) – Von Willebrand factor (vWF) bonds, as well as the interaction between flowing platelets and adherent platelets, are two key events that take place immediately following blood vessel injury. This early-stage platelet deposition and accumulation triggers the initiation of hemostasis, a self-defensive mechanism to prevent the body from excessive blood loss. To understand and predict this complex process, one must integrate experimentally determined information on the mechanics and biochemical kinetics of participating receptors over very small time frames (1–1000 μs) and length scales (10–100 nm), to collective phenomena occurring over seconds and tens of microns. In the present study, a unique three dimensional multiscale computational model, Platelet Adhesive Dynamics (PAD), was applied to elucidate the unique physics of (i) a non-spherical, disk-shaped platelet interacting and tethering onto the damaged vessel wall followed by (ii) collisional interactions between a flowing platelet with a downstream adherent platelet. By analyzing numerous simulations under different physiological conditions, we conclude that the platelet’s unique spheroid-shape provides heterogeneous, orientation-dependent translocation (rolling) behavior which enhances cell-wall interactions. We also conclude that platelet–platelet near field interactions are critical for cell–cell communication during the initiation of microthrombi. The PAD model described here helps to identify the physical factors that control the initial stages of platelet capture during this process.},

The networks considered are subisostatic random-bond networks that, in the athermal limit, are known to have vanishing bulk and linear shear moduli at zero bulk strain. Above a bulk strain threshold, however, these networks become rigid, although surprisingly the shear modulus remains zero until a second, higher, strain threshold. We find that thermal fluctuations stabilize all networks below the rigidity transition, resulting in systems with both finite bulk and shear moduli. Our results show a T0.66 temperature dependence of the moduli in the region below the bulk strain threshold, resulting in networks with anomalously high rigidity as compared to ordinary entropic elasticity. Furthermore, we find a second regime of anomalous temperature scaling for the shear modulus at its zero-temperature rigidity point, where it scales as T0.5, behavior that is absent for the bulk modulus since its athermal rigidity transition is discontinuous.},

As cell density increases, individual cells retain the same stiffness-dependent differences unless they are very close or in molecular contact. On nonlinear strain-stiffening fibrin gels, the same cell types become maximally spread even when the low strain elastic modulus would predict a round morphology, and cells are influenced by the presence of neighbors hundreds of microns away. Time lapse microscopy reveals that fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells on fibrin deform the substrate by several microns up to five cell lengths away from their plasma membrane through a force limited mechanism. Atomic force microscopy and rheology confirm that these strains locally and globally stiffen the gel, depending on cell density, and this effect leads to long distance cell-cell communication and alignment. Thus cells are acutely responsive to the nonlinear elasticity of their substrates and can manipulate this rheological property to induce patterning.},

	abstract = {In this report we review the fundamentals, applications and future tendencies of dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. Our focus is on understanding why the changes observed in the dynamic properties of a vibrating tip that interacts with a surface make possible to obtain molecular resolution images of membrane proteins in aqueous solutions or to resolve atomic-scale surface defects in ultra high vacuum (UHV). Our description of the two major dynamic AFM modes, amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) and frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) emphasises their common points without ignoring the differences in experimental set-ups and operating conditions. Those differences are introduced by the different feedback parameters, oscillation amplitude in AM-AFM and frequency shift and excitation amplitude in FM-AFM, used to track the topography and composition of a surface.

The theoretical analysis of AM-AFM (also known as tapping-mode) emphasises the coexistence, in many situations of interests, of two stable oscillation states, a low and high amplitude solution. The coexistence of those oscillation states is a consequence of the presence of attractive and repulsive components in the interaction force and their non-linear dependence on the tip–surface separation. We show that key relevant experimental properties such as the lateral resolution, image contrast and sample deformation are highly dependent on the oscillation state chosen to operate the instrument. AM-AFM allows to obtain simultaneous topographic and compositional contrast in heterogeneous samples by recording the phase angle difference between the external excitation and the tip motion (phase imaging). Significant applications of AM-AFM such as high-resolution imaging of biomolecules and polymers, large-scale patterning of silicon surfaces, manipulation of single nanoparticles or the fabrication of single electron devices are also reviewed.

FM-AFM (also called non-contact AFM—NC-AFM) has achieved the long-standing goal of true atomic resolution with AFM in UHV. Our analysis starts with a discussion of the relation between frequency shifts and tip–surface interactions, emphasising the ability of perturbation theory to describe the measured frequency shift. We discuss the role of short-range chemical interactions in the atomic contrast, with particular attention to semiconductor and ionic (alkali halides and oxides) surfaces. Also included is a detailed quantitative comparison between theoretical simulations and experiment. Inversion procedures, the determination of the tip–sample interaction from the frequency shift versus distance curves above specific sites, are also reviewed. We finish with a discussion of the optimal range of experimental operation parameters, and the use of damping (excitation amplitude) as a source of atomic contrast, including the possible interpretation in terms of microscopic dissipation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Despite their overwhelming complexity, living cells display a high degree of internal mechanical and functional organization which can largely be attributed to the intracellular biopolymer scaffold, the cytoskeleton. Being a very complex system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the cytoskeleton's ability to organize is at the same time challenging and fascinating. The extensive amounts of frequently interacting cellular building blocks and their inherent multifunctionality permits highly adaptive behavior and obstructs a purely reductionist approach. Nevertheless (and despite the field's relative novelty), the physics approach has already proved to be extremely successful in revealing very fundamental concepts of cytoskeleton organization and behavior. This review aims at introducing the physics of the cytoskeleton ranging from single biopolymer filaments to multicellular organisms. Throughout this wide range of phenomena, the focus is set on the intertwined nature of the different physical scales (levels of complexity) that give rise to numerous emergent properties by means of self-organization or self-assembly.},

	abstract = {The endpoint distribution and dynamics of semiflexible fibers are studied by numerical simulation. A brief overview is given over the analytical theory of flexible and semiflexible polymers. In particular, a closed expression is given for the relaxation spectrum of wormlike chains, which determines polymer diffusion and rheology. Next a simulation model for wormlike chains with full hydrodynamic interaction is described, and relations for the bending and torsion modulus are given. Two methods are introduced to include torsion stiffness into the model. The model is validated by simulating single chains in a heat bath, and comparing the endpoint distribution of the chains with established Monte Carlo results. It is concluded that torsion stiffness leads to a slightly shorter effective persistence length for a given bending stiffness. To further validate the simulation model, polymer diffusion is studied for fixed persistence length and varying polymer length N. The diffusion constant shows crossover from Rouse (D ∝ N −1) to reptation behaviour (D ∝ N −2). The terminal relaxation time obtained from the monomer displacement is consistent with the theory of wormlike chains. The probability for chain crossing has also been studied. This probability is so low that it does not influence the present results.},

In particular, we propose new characterizations which hold in dimensions 2, 3 and 4, and which lead to efficient algorithms for detecting P-simple points and minimal non-simple sets.},

	abstract = {The mechanics of biological tissue is largely determined by the mechanics of biopolymer networks such as the extracellular matrix on cellular scale or the cytoskeleton on subcellular scale. Micromechanical simulations of biopolymer networks have thus attracted increasing interest in the last years. Here we introduce a simulation framework for biopolymer networks based on a finite element model of the filaments with a backward Euler time integration scheme. This approach surpasses previously published ones, especially those based on bead-spring models, by its sound theoretical foundation, a great flexibility, and at the same time an efficiency gain of approximately two orders of magnitude. Thereby it allows for addressing problems no previous numerical method could deal with, e.g., the micromechanical analysis of the viscoelastic moduli of crosslinked biopolymer networks in the low frequency regime or the analysis of the thermal equilibrium phases of such networks. By means of several examples it is discussed how this capacity can be exploited in multiscale simulations of biological tissue on cellular and subcellular scale.},

	abstract = {Propulsion by growing actin networks is a universal mechanism used in many different biological systems, ranging from the sheet-like lamellipodium of crawling animal cells to the actin comet tails induced by certain bacteria and viruses in order to move within their host cells. Although the core molecular machinery for actin network growth is well preserved in all of these cases, the geometry of the propelled obstacle varies considerably. During recent years, filament orientation distribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the structure and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several continuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing behind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady state orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete filaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate that for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation patterns peaked at either ±35° or +70°/0°/ − 70° exhibit mutually exclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of very large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a function of model parameters and show how this approach can be extended to obstacles with piecewise straight contours. For curved obstacles, we arrive at a partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which again is in good agreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same two fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an appropriate reference frame, which is adjusted to the local orientation of the obstacle contour. Our results suggest that two fundamentally different network architectures compete with each other in growing actin networks, irrespective of obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data have to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.},

	abstract = {Automated tracing of neuronal processes from 3D confocal microscopy images is essential for quantitative neuroanatomy and neuronal assays. Two basic approaches are described in the literature—one based on skeletonization and another based on sequential tracing along neuronal processes. This article presents algorithms for improving the rate of detection, and the accuracy of estimating the location and process angles at branching points for the latter class of algorithms. The problem of simultaneously detecting branch points and estimating their measurements is formulated as a generalized likelihood ratio test defined on a spatial neighborhood of each candidate point, in which likelihoods were computed using a ridge detection approach. The average detection rate increased from from 37 to 86\%. The average error in locating the branch points decreased from 2.6 to 2.1 voxels in 3D images. The generalized hypothesis test improves the rate of detection of branching points, and the accuracy of location estimates, enabling a more complete extraction of neuroanatomy and more accurate counting of branch points in neuronal assays. More accurate branch point morphometry is valuable for image registration and change analysis. © 2007 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

	abstract = {The central role of the cytoskeleton in both healthy and diseased cellular functions makes it a compelling subject for detailed three-dimensional (3D) micromechanical modeling. Microstructural features of the cytoskeleton govern the cell’s mechanical behavior in many of the regulating cellular functions including cell division, adhesion, spreading, migration, contraction, and other mechanotransductive effects which influence biochemical processes. Actin microfilaments (AF) combine to form one of the predominant cytoskeletal networks important to these biological processes.
Here, the AF cytoskeletal microstructure and stress-strain behavior is modeled via a microstructurally-informed continuum mechanics approach. The force-extension behavior of the individual filaments is captured using the MacKintosh derivation of the worm-like chain (WLC) constitutive relationship for short chains where a new and direct analytical expression for the filament force as a function of filament extension is developed in this paper. The filament force-extension behavior is then used in conjunction with the Arruda-Boyce eight-chain network model to capture the 3D multiaxial stress-strain behavior of the network. The resulting 3D cytoskeletal network constitutive model provides the ability to track microstructural stretch and orientation states during 3D macroscopic stretching conditions. The non-affine nature of the network model effectively accommodates the imposed macroscopic shear strain through filament rotation and a relatively small amount of filament stretch. These characteristics enable the network model, using physically realistic material properties, to capture the initial stiffness of the AF network as well as the nonlinear strain stiffening observed at large stresses. The network model predictions compare favorably with published microrheological data of in vitro AF networks.},

Unlike simple polymer gels, many biological materials—including blood vessels, mesentery tissue, lung parenchyma, cornea and blood clots—stiffen as they are strained, thereby preventing large deformations that could threaten tissue integrity. The molecular structures and design principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress–strain relations at low to intermediate strains. The input to this theory is the force–extension curve for individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these filaments are homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly. This theory shows that systems of filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen at low strains without requiring a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffness.},

The “egg-box” model describes the gel-inducing ions embodied in cavities formed by sequences of α-L-GulA of the alginate copolymers in a pairing reaction yielding junction zones. Small-angle X-ray scattering showed that the cross-sectional radius of gyration for an alginate with fraction of α-L-GulA, FG, = 0.39, increased from Rg,c = 3.5Å for alginate in solution to 7.6Å for homogeneous Ca-gels at [Ca2+] = 10 mM. The homogeneous Ca-alginate gels were obtained by in situ release of Ca2+ from Ca-EGTA or CaCO3 using a slowly hydrolyzing lactone. Either increasing the [Ca2+] for a given FG or increasing FG by selection of an alginate from a different seaweed specie and using constant [Ca2+], yielded larger initial slopes and curvature in the cross-sectional plots of the SAXS data. This indicate the coexistence of junction zones differing in multiplicity characterized by shifting the distribution towards larger multiplicity either for increasing FG or [Ca2+]. The present finding of junction zone formation by lateral condensation of α-L-GulA sequences depending on the composition of alginate and Ca-concentration are significant extensions of the “egg-box” model that correlate the sequential arrangement of α-L-GulA and β-D-ManA in alginate to the structure of the junction zones in the Ca-alginate gels.},

	abstract = {Atomic force microscope manipulations of single polysaccharide molecules have recently expanded conformational chemistry to include force-driven transitions between the chair and boat conformers of the pyranose ring structure. We now expand these observations to include chair inversion, a common phenomenon in the conformational chemistry of six-membered ring molecules. We demonstrate that by stretching single pectin molecules (1 → 4-linked α-d-galactouronic acid polymer), we could change the pyranose ring conformation from a chair to a boat and then to an inverted chair in a clearly resolved two-step conversion: 4C1 ⇄ boat ⇄ 1C4. The two-step extension of the distance between the glycosidic oxygen atoms O1 and O4 determined by atomic force microscope manipulations is corroborated by ab initio calculations of the increase in length of the residue vector O1O4 on chair inversion. We postulate that this conformational change results from the torque generated by the glycosidic bonds when a force is applied to the pectin molecule. Hence, the glycosidic bonds act as mechanical levers, driving the conformational transitions of the pyranose ring. When the glycosidic bonds are equatorial (e), the torque is zero, causing no conformational change. However, when the glycosidic bond is axial (a), torque is generated, causing a rotation around C—C bonds and a conformational change. This hypothesis readily predicts the number of transitions observed in pyranose monomers with 1a-4a linkages (two), 1a-4e (one), and 1e-4e (none). Our results demonstrate single-molecule mechanochemistry with the capability of resolving complex conformational transitions.},

	abstract = {Development of epithelial precancer and cancer leads to well-documented molecular and structural changes in the epithelium. Recently, it has been recognized that stromal biology is also altered significantly with preinvasive disease. We used the finite-difference time-domain method, a popular technique in computational electromagnetics, to model light scattering from heterogeneous collagen fiber networks and to analyze how neoplastic changes alter stromal scattering properties. Three-dimensional optical images from the stroma of fresh normal and neoplastic oral-cavity biopsies were acquired using fluorescence confocal microscopy. These optical sections were then processed to create realistic three-dimensional collagen networks as model input. Image analysis revealed that the volume fraction of collagen fibers in the stroma decreases with precancer and cancer progression, and fibers tend to be shorter and more disconnected in neoplastic stroma. The finite-difference time-domain modeling results showed that neoplastic fiber networks have smaller scattering cross sections compared to normal networks. Computed scattering-phase functions indicate that high-angle scattering probabilities tend to be higher for neoplastic networks. These results provide valuable insight into the micro-optical properties of normal and neoplastic stroma. Characterization of optical signals obtained from epithelial tissues can aid in development of optical spectroscopic and imaging techniques for noninvasive monitoring of early neoplastic changes.},

	abstract = {By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of semiflexible polymers in d=2 dimensions the applicability of the Kratky-Porod model is tested. This model is widely used as standard model for describing conformations and force vs. extension curves of stiff polymers. It is shown that semiflexible polymers in d=2 show a crossover from hard rods to self-avoiding walks, the intermediate Gaussian regime (implied by the Kratky-Porod model) is completely absent. Hence the latter can also describe force vs. extension curves only if the contour length is only a few times larger than the persistence length. Consequences for experiments on biopolymers at interfaces are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Discrete amorphous materials are best described in terms of arbitrary networks which can be embedded in three dimensional space. Investigating the thermodynamic equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium behavior of such materials around second order phase transitions call for special techniques. We set up a renormalization group scheme by expanding an arbitrary scalar field living on the nodes of an arbitrary network, in terms of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian. The renormalization transformation involves, as usual, the integration over the more rapidly varying components of the field, corresponding to eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues, and then rescaling. The critical exponents depend on the particular graph through the spectral density of the eigenvalues.},

Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.},

This additional information allows a library user to write algorithms respecting topological constraints, for example, a seed fill or a skeletonization algorithm. As digital topology is absent from most image-processing libraries, such constraints cannot be fulfilled. We describe and give code samples for all the structures necessary for this integration, and show a use case in the form of a homotopic thinning filter inside ITK. The obtained filter can be up to a hundred times as fast as ITK's thinning filter and works for any image dimension. This paper mainly deals of integration within ITK, but can be adapted with only minor modifications to other image-processing libraries.},

	abstract = {We show that the nonlinear mechanical response of networks formed from un–cross-linked fibrin or collagen type I continually changes in response to repeated large-strain loading. We demonstrate that this dynamic evolution of the mechanical response arises from a shift of a characteristic nonlinear stress–strain relationship to higher strains. Therefore, the imposed loading does not weaken the underlying matrices but instead delays the occurrence of the strain stiffening. Using confocal microscopy, we present direct evidence that this behavior results from persistent lengthening of individual fibers caused by an interplay between fiber stretching and fiber buckling when the networks are repeatedly strained. Moreover, we show that covalent cross-linking of fibrin or collagen inhibits the shift of the nonlinear material response, suggesting that the molecular origin of individual fiber lengthening may be slip of monomers within the fibers. Thus, a fibrous architecture in combination with constituents that exhibit internal plasticity creates a material whose mechanical response adapts to external loading conditions. This design principle may be useful to engineer novel materials with this capability.},

When all diagrams are included, less specific results are found. One conclusion is that the shape of the charge distribution surrounding a test charge in the vacuum does not, at small distances, depend on the coupling constant except through a scale factor.

We take advantage of the properties of this framework, to propose a generic thinning scheme for obtaining “thin” skeletons from objects made of voxels. From this scheme, we derive algorithms that produce curve or surface skeletons, based on the notion of 1D or 2D isthmus. We compare our new curve thinning algorithm with all the published algorithms of the same kind, based on quantitative criteria. Our experiments show that our algorithm largely outperforms the other ones with respect to noise sensitivity. Furthermore, we show how to slightly modify our algorithms to include a filtering parameter that controls effectively the pruning of skeletons, based on the notion of isthmus persistence.},

	abstract = {Biological semiflexible polymers and filaments such as collagen, fibronectin, actin, microtubules, coiled-coil proteins, DNA, siRNA, amyloid fibrils, etc., are ubiquitous in nature. In biology, these systems have a direct relation to critical processes ranging from the movement of actin or assembly of viruses at cellular interfaces to the growth of amyloid plaques in neurodegenerative diseases. In technology and applied sciences, synthetic macromolecules or fibrous objects such as carbon nanotubes are involved in countless applications. Accessing their intrinsic properties at the single molecule level, such as their molecular conformations or intrinsic stiffness, is central to the understanding of these systems, their properties, and the design of related applications. In this Perspective we introduce FiberApp?a new tracking and analysis software based on a cascade of algorithms describing structural and topological features of objects characterized by a very high length-to-width aspect ratio, generally described as ?fiber-like objects?. The program operates on images from any microscopic source (atomic force or transmission electron microscopy, optical, fluorescence, confocal, etc.), acquiring the spatial coordinates of objects by a semiautomated tracking procedure based on A* pathfinding algorithm followed by the application of active contour models and generating virtually any statistical, topological, and graphical output derivable from these coordinates. Demonstrative features of the software include statistical polymer physics analysis of fiber conformations, height, bond and pair correlation functions, mean-squared end-to-end distance and midpoint displacement, 2D order parameter, excess kurtosis, fractal exponent, height profile and its discrete Fourier transform, orientation, length, height, curvature, and kink angle distributions, providing an unprecedented structural description of filamentous synthetic and biological objects.},

	abstract = {The skeleton is an important representation for shape analysis. A common approach for generating discrete skeletons takes three steps: 1) computing the distance map, 2) detecting maximal disks from the distance map, and 3) linking the centers of maximal disks (CMDs) into a connected skeleton. Algorithms using approximate distance metrics are abundant and their theory has been well established. However, the resulting skeletons may be inaccurate and sensitive to rotation. In this paper, we study methods for generating skeletons based on the exact Euclidean metric. We first show that no previous algorithms identify the exact set of discrete maximal disks under the Euclidean metric. We then propose new algorithms and show that they are correct. To link CMDs into connected skeletons, we examine two prevalent approaches: connected thinning and steepest ascent. We point out that the connected thinning approach does not work properly for Euclidean distance maps. Only the steepest ascent algorithm produces skeletons that are truly medially placed. The resulting skeletons have all the desirable properties: they have the same simple connectivity as the figure, they are well-centered, they are insensitive to rotation, and they allow exact reconstruction. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated with numerous examples},

Many materials, including all macroscopically isotropic amorphous ones, have elastic moduli that vary randomly with position, and they necessarily undergo nonaffine distortions in response to external stress. We study general aspects of nonaffine response and correlation using analytic calculations and numerical simulations. We define nonaffine displacements \${\textbackslash}uv' ({\textbackslash}xv)\$ as the difference between \${\textbackslash}uv ({\textbackslash}xv)\$ and affine displacements, and we investigate the nonaffinity correlation function \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{G\} = {\textless} [{\textbackslash}uv'({\textbackslash}xv) - {\textbackslash}uv' (0)]{\textasciicircum}2{\textgreater}\$ and related functions. We introduce four model random systems with random elastic moduli induced by locally random spring constants, by random coordination number, by random stress, or by any combination of these. We show analytically and numerically that \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{G\}\$ scales as \$A {\textbar}{\textbackslash}xv{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{-(d-2)\}\$ where the amplitude \$A\$ is proportional to the variance of local elastic moduli regardless of the origin of their randomness. We show that the driving force for nonaffine displacements is a spatial derivative of the random elastic constant tensor times the constant affine strain. Random stress by itself does not drive nonaffine response, though the randomness in elastic moduli it may generate does. We study models with both short and long-range correlations in random elastic moduli.},

	abstract = {Abstract-The scale-space technique introduced by Witkin involves generating coarser resolution images by convolving the original image with a Gaussian kernel. This approach has a major drawback: it is difficult to obtain accurately the locations of the “semantically mean-ingful ” edges at coarse scales. In this paper we suggest a new definition of scale-space, and introduce a class of algorithms that realize it using a diffusion process. The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing in preference to interregion smoothing. It is shown that the “no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales ” property of conventional scale space is pre-served. As the region boundaries in our approach remain sharp, we obtain a high quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. The algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image making parallel hardware implementations feasible.

The topology of network graphs revealed small-world properties for very different real systems among these neuronal networks. In this study, we observed the early development of mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) networks in vitro using time-lapse video microscopy. By means of a time-resolved graph theoretical analysis of the connectivity, shortest path length and the edge length, we were able to discover the different stages during the network formation. Starting from single cells, at the first stage neurons connected to each other ending up in a network with maximum complexity. In the further course, we observed a simplification of the network which manifested in a change of relevant network parameters such as the minimization of the path length. Moreover, we found that RGC networks self-organized as small-world networks at both stages; however, the optimization occurred only in the second stage.},

	abstract = {We investigated membrane-like polymer structures of fractal connectivity such as Sierpinski gaskets and Sierpinski carpets applying the bond fluctuation model in three dimensions. Without excluded volume (phantom), both polymeric fractals obey Gaussian elasticity on larger scales determined by their spectral dimension. On the other hand, the swelling effect due to excluded volume is rather distinct between the two polymeric fractals: Self-avoiding Sierpinski gaskets can be described using a Flory-type mean-field argument. Sierpinski carpets having a spectral dimension closer to perfect membranes are significantly more strongly swollen than predicted. Based on our simulation results it cannot be excluded that Sierpinski carpets in athermal solvent show a flat phase on larger scales. We tested the self-consistency of Flory predictions using a virial expansion to higher orders. From this we conclude that the third virial coefficient contributes marginally to Sierpinski gaskets, but higher order virial coefficients are relevant for Sierpinski carpets.},

	abstract = {Self-assembled hydrogen-bonded networks of the polysaccharide pectin, a mechanically functional component of plant cell walls, have been of recent interest as biomimetic exemplars of physical gels, and the micro-rheological and strain-stiffening behaviour have been previously investigated. Despite this detailed rheological characterisation of pre-formed gels, little is known about the fundamental arrangement of the polymers into cross-linking junction zones, the size of these bonded regions, and the resultant network architecture in these hydrogen-bonded materials, especially in contrast to the plethora of such information available for their well-known calcium-assembled counterparts. In this work, in concert with pertinent rheological measurements, an in-depth structural study of the hydrogen-bond-mediated gelation of pectins is provided. Gels were realised by using glucona-delta-lactone (GDL) to decrease the pH of solutions of pectic polymers that had a (blockwise) low degree of methylesterification (low DM). Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to access structural information on length scales on the order of nanometres to hundreds of nanometres, while complementary mechanical properties were measured, predominantly using small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology.},

The audience is mainly first-year graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however. The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is, arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and instantons via path integrals. For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic) of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field theory.},

We start with a broad introduction to the field and emphasize its connections with other subjects and its relevance. The important role played by computer simulations to study and understand the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is spelled out. We review the recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics. We then present the main theoretical approaches describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures, and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, we give an extensive overview of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that, we believe, will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.},

	abstract = {A systematic analysis of the Burgers–Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in d+1 dimensions by dynamic renormalization-group theory is described. The fixed points and exponents are calculated to two-loop order. We use the dimensional regularization scheme, carefully keeping the full d dependence originating from the angular parts of the loop integrals. For dimensions less than dc=2 we find a strong-coupling fixed point, which diverges at d=2, indicating that there is nonperturbative strong-coupling behavior for all d≥2. At d=1 our method yields the identical fixed point as in the one-loop approximation, and the two-loop contributions to the scaling functions are nonsingular. For d{\textgreater}2 dimensions, there is no finite strong-coupling fixed point. In the framework of a 2+ε expansion, we find the dynamic exponent corresponding to the unstable fixed point, which described the nonequilibrium roughening transition, to be z=2+O(ε3), in agreement with a recent scaling argument by Doty and Kosterlitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 1979 (1992)]. Similarly, our result for the correlation length exponent at the transition is 1/ν=ε+O(ε3). For the smooth phase, some aspects of the crossover from Gaussian to critical behavior are discussed.},

	abstract = {Single-particle tracking (SPT) is of growing importance in the biophysical community. It is used to investigate processes such as drug and gene delivery, viral uptake, intracellular trafficking or membrane-bound protein mobility. Traditionally, SPT is performed in two dimensions (2D) because of its technical simplicity. However, life occurs in three dimensions (3D) and many methods have been recently developed to track particles in 3D. Now, is the third dimension worth the effort? Here we investigate the differences between the 2D and 3D analyses of intracellular transport with the 3D development of a time-resolved mean square displacement (MSD) analysis introduced previously. The 3D trajectories, and the 2D projections, of fluorescent nanoparticles were obtained with an orbital tracking microscope in two different cell types: in Dictyostelium discoideum ameba and in adherent, more flattened HuH-7 human cells. As expected from the different 3D organization of both cells’ cytoskeletons, a third of the active transport was lost upon projection in the ameba whereas the identification of the active phases was barely affected in the HuH-7 cells. In both cell types, we found intracellular diffusion to be anisotropic and the diffusion coefficient values derived from the 2D analysis were therefore biased.},

	abstract = {Material moduli of the cytoskeleton (CSK) influence a wide range of cell functions. There is substantial evidence from reconstituted F-actin gels that a regime exists in which the moduli scale with frequency with a universal exponent of 3/4. Such behaviour is entropic in origin and is attributable to fluctuations in semiflexible polymers driven by thermal forces, but it is not obvious a priori that such entropic effects are responsible for the elasticity of the CSK. Here we demonstrate the existence of such a regime in the living cell, but only at high frequencies. Fast events scaled with frequency in a manner comparable to semiflexible-polymer dynamics, but slow events scaled with a non-universal exponent that was systematically smaller than 3/4 and probably more consistent with a soft-glass regime. These findings strongly suggest that at smaller timescales elasticity arises from entropic fluctuations of a semiflexible-filament network, whereas on longer timescales slow (soft-glass-like) dynamics of a different origin prevail. The transition between these two regimes occurred on timescales of the order of 0.01 s, thus setting within the slow glassy regime cellular events such as spreading, crawling, contracting, and invading.},

We analytically study the nonlinear force–extension relation of an array of parallel-aligned, strongly stretched semiflexible polymers with random cross-links. In the strong stretching limit, the effect of the cross-links is purely entropic, independent of the bending rigidity of the chains. Cross-links enhance the differential stretching stiffness of the bundle. For hard cross-links, the cross-link contribution to the force–extension relation scales inversely proportional to the force. Its dependence on the cross-link density, close to the gelation transition, is the same as that of the shear modulus. The qualitative behaviour is captured by a toy model of two chains with a single cross-link in the middle.},

We study the critical exponentsv and 2Δ 4 −γ as well as several universal amplitude ratios; in particular, we make an extremely sensitive test of the hyperscaling relationdv = 2Δ 4 −γ. In two dimensions, we confirm the predicted exponentv=3/4 and the hyperscaling relation; we estimate the universal ratios {\textless}R g 2 {\textgreater}/{\textless}R e 2 {\textgreater}=0.14026±0.00007, {\textless}R m 2 {\textgreater}/{\textless}R e 2 {\textgreater}=0.43961±0.00034, and Ψ*=0.66296±0.00043 (68\% confidence limits). In three dimensions, we estimatev=0.5877±0.0006 with a correctionto-scaling exponentΔ 1=0.56±0.03 (subjective 68\% confidence limits). This value forv agrees excellently with the field-theoretic renormalization-group prediction, but there is some discrepancy forΔ 1. Earlier Monte Carlo estimates ofv, which were ≈0.592, are now seen to be biased by corrections to scaling. We estimate the universal ratios {\textless}R g 2 {\textgreater}/{\textless}R e 2 {\textgreater}=0.1599±0.0002 and Ψ*=0.2471±0.0003; since Ψ*{\textgreater}0, hyperscaling holds. The approach to Ψ* is from above, contrary to the prediction of the two-parameter renormalization-group theory. We critically reexamine this theory, and explain where the error lies. In an appendix, we prove rigorously (modulo some standard scaling assumptions) the hyperscaling relationdv = 2Δ 4 −γ for two-dimensional SAWs.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Digital reconstruction, or tracing, of 3D neuron structures is critical toward reverse engineering the wiring and functions of a brain. However, despite a number of existing studies, this task is still challenging, especially when a 3D microscopic image has low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fragmented neuron segments. Published work can handle these hard situations only by introducing global prior information, such as where a neurite segment starts and terminates. However, manual incorporation of such global information can be very time consuming. Thus, a completely automatic approach for these hard situations is highly desirable.
Results: We have developed an automatic graph algorithm, called the all-path pruning (APP), to trace the 3D structure of a neuron. To avoid potential mis-tracing of some parts of a neuron, an APP first produces an initial over-reconstruction, by tracing the optimal geodesic shortest path from the seed location to every possible destination voxel/pixel location in the image. Since the initial reconstruction contains all the possible paths and thus could contain redundant structural components (SC), we simplify the entire reconstruction without compromising its connectedness by pruning the redundant structural elements, using a new maximal-covering minimal-redundant (MCMR) subgraph algorithm. We show that MCMR has a linear computational complexity and will converge. We examined the performance of our method using challenging 3D neuronal image datasets of model organisms (e.g. fruit fly).
Availability: The software is available upon request. We plan to eventually release the software as a plugin of the V3D-Neuron package at http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/v3d.

	abstract = {Protein adsorption plays a significant role in biological phenomena such as cell-surface interactions and the coagulation of blood. Two-dimensional random sequential adsorption (RSA) models are widely used to model the adsorption of proteins on solid surfaces. Continuum equations have been developed so that the results of RSA simulations can be used to predict the kinetics of adsorption. Recently, Brownian dynamics simulations have become popular for modeling protein adsorption. In this work a continuum model was developed to allow the results from a Brownian dynamics simulation to be used as the boundary condition in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Brownian dynamics simulations were used to model the diffusive transport of hard-sphere particles in a liquid and the adsorption of the particles onto a solid surface. The configuration of the adsorbed particles was analyzed to quantify the chemical potential near the surface, which was found to be a function of the distance from the surface and the fractional surface coverage. The near-surface chemical potential was used to derive a continuum model of adsorption that incorporates the results from the Brownian dynamics simulations. The equations of the continuum model were discretized and coupled to a CFD simulation of diffusive transport to the surface. The kinetics of adsorption predicted by the continuum model closely matched the results from the Brownian dynamics simulation. This new model allows the results from mesoscale simulations to be incorporated into micro- or macro-scale CFD transport simulations of protein adsorption in practical devices.},

We present a detailed dynamical renormalization-group analysis of this equation subject to random noise. The noise itself can be the product of another stochastic process and is hence allowed to have correlations in space and/or time. In dimensions higher than a critical dc weak and strong noise lead to different scaling exponents, while for d{\textless}dc any amount of noise is relevant resulting in strong-coupling behavior. In the absence of temporal correlations we find two regimes for d{\textless}dc: either the hydrodynamic behavior is determined by white noise and correlations are unimportant, or correlations dominate and the resulting scaling exponents can be obtained exactly. With temporal correlations present, the hydrodynamic behavior is much more complex, as renormalization predicts a complicated dependence of the effective noise spectrum on frequency in certain regimes. The relevance of these results to two interesting problems is discussed. One is the anomalous transverse fluctuations of a directed polymer in a random medium, and the other is a description of a growing interface.

Stretch is a potent stimulus for growth, differentiation, migration, remodelling and gene expression. Here, we report that in response to transient stretch the cytoskeleton fluidizes in such a way as to define a universal response class. This finding implicates mechanisms mediated not only by specific signalling intermediates, as is usually assumed, but also by non-specific actions of a slowly evolving network of physical forces. These results support the idea that the cell interior is at once a crowded chemical space and a fragile soft material in which the effects of biochemistry, molecular crowding and physical forces are complex and inseparable, yet conspire nonetheless to yield remarkably simple phenomenological laws. These laws seem to be both universal and primitive, and thus comprise a striking intersection between the worlds of cell biology and soft matter physics.},

The model adapts existing models in order to accommodate one or more force-induced conformational transformations of the glycan rings and is based on the concept of equilibrium between the clicked (longer conformers) and unclicked states. This equilibrium is determined by the Gibbs energy difference between these two states which is perturbed in favor of the clicked states by the force applied to the molecule. The derived expression is used to generate force-extension curves for model polymers and can illustrate the effect of the Gibbs energy for each transformation on the shape of these curves. It is also used to fit the force-extension curves of polysaccharides to obtain the Gibbs energy differences between the conformers. Good agreement was found between this model and experimental data on carboxymethylamylose, dextran, alginate, and pectin.},

The main objective of this study is to propose a new method to analyze this microcirculation. Methods: From thick sections of india ink-injected human brain, using confocal laser microscopy, the authors developed algorithms adapted to very large data sets to automatically extract and analyze center lines together with diameters of thousands of brain microvessels within a large cortex area. Results: Direct comparison between the original data and the processed vascular skeletons demonstrated the high reliability of this method and its capability to manage a large amount of data, from which morphometry and topology of the cerebral microcirculation could be derived. Conclusions: Among the many parameters that can be analyzed by this method, the capillary size, the frequency distributions of diameters and lengths, the fractal nature of these networks, and the depth-related density of vessels are all vital features for an adequate model of cerebral microcirculation.},

	abstract = {The control of compliant robots is, due to their often nonlinear and complex dynamics, inherently difficult. The vision of morphological computation proposes to view these aspects not only as problems, but rather also as parts of the solution. Non-rigid body parts are not seen anymore as imperfect realizations of rigid body parts, but rather as potential computational resources. The applicability of this vision has already been demonstrated for a variety of complex robot control problems. Nevertheless, a theoretical basis for understanding the capabilities and limitations of morphological computation has been missing so far. We present a model for morphological computation with compliant bodies, where a precise mathematical characterization of the potential computational contribution of a complex physical body is feasible. The theory suggests that complexity and nonlinearity, typically unwanted properties of robots, are desired features in order to provide computational power. We demonstrate that simple generic models of physical bodies, based on mass-spring systems, can be used to implement complex nonlinear operators. By adding a simple readout (which is static and linear) to the morphology such devices are able to emulate complex mappings of input to output streams in continuous time. Hence, by outsourcing parts of the computation to the physical body, the difficult problem of learning to control a complex body, could be reduced to a simple and perspicuous learning task, which can not get stuck in local minima of an error function.},

One concrete model, based on minimum-time routes in a binary hierarchy of roads with different speed limits, has been shown to satisfy the axioms, and two other constructions (based on Poisson line processes and on dynamic proximity graphs) are expected also to do so. We initiate study of structure theory and summary statistics for general processes in the class.

Several fractal and non-fractal parameters have been considered for the quantitative assessment of the vascular architecture, using a variety of test specimens and of computational tools. The fractal parameters have the advantage of being scale invariant, i.e. to be independent of the magnification and resolution of the images to be investigated, making easier the comparison among different setups and experiments.

Results
The success of several commercial and/or free codes in computing the fractal parameters has been tested on well known exact models. Based on such a preliminary study, we selected the code Frac-lac in order to analyze images obtained by visualizing the angiogenetic process occurring in chick Chorio Allontoic Membranes (CAM), assumed to be paradigmatic of a realistic 2D vascular network. Among the parameters investigated, the fractal dimension Df proved to be the most robust estimator for CAM vascular networks. Moreover, only Df was able to discriminate between effective and elusive increases in vascularization after drug-induced angiogenic stimulations on CAMs.

Conclusion
The fractal dimension Df is likely to be the most promising tool for monitoring the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapies in various clinical contexts.},

We consider generic open graphs and show that any cycle leads to narrow resonances which do not fit in any of the prominent paradigms for narrow resonances (classical barriers, localization due to disorder, chaotic scattering). We call these resonances “topological” to emphasize their origin in the nontrivial connectivity. Topological resonances have a clear and unique signature which is apparent in the statistics of the resonance parameters (such as, e.g., the width, the delay time, or the wave-function intensity in the graph). We discuss this phenomenon by providing analytical arguments supported by numerical simulation, and identify the features of the above distributions which depend on genuine topological quantities such as the length of the shortest cycle (girth). These signatures cannot be explained using any of the other paradigms for narrow resonances. Finally, we propose an experimental setting where the topological resonances could be demonstrated, and study the stability of the relevant distribution functions to moderate dissipation.},

	abstract = {The same fundamental questions that have driven enquiry into cytoskeletal mechanics can be asked of the considerably less-studied, yet arguably just as important, biopolymer matrix in the plant cell wall. In this case, it is well-known that polysaccharides, rather than filamentous and tubular protein assemblies, play a major role in satisfying the mechanical requirements of a successful cell wall, but developing a clear structure–function understanding has been exacerbated by the familiar issue of biological complexity. Herein, in the spirit of the mesoscopic approaches that have proved so illuminating in the study of cytoskeletal networks, the linear microrheological and strain-stiffening responses of biopolymeric networks reconstituted from pectin, a crucial cell wall polysaccharide, are examined. These are found to be well-captured by the glassy worm-like chain (GWLC) model of self-assembled semi-flexible filaments. Strikingly, the nonlinear mechanical response of these pectin networks is found to be much more sensitive to temperature changes than their linear response, a property that is also observed in F-actin networks, and is well reproduced by the GWLC model. Additionally, microrheological measurements suggest that over long timescales ({\textgreater}10 s) internal stresses continue to redistribute facilitating low frequency motions of tracer particles.},

Cell Sci. 104, 613-627). The cellular tensegrity model can now be revisited and placed in context of new advances in our understanding of cell structure, biological networks and mechanoregulation that have been made over the past decade. Recent work provides strong evidence to support the use of tensegrity by cells, and mathematical formulations of the model predict many aspects of cell behavior. In addition, development of the tensegrity theory and its translation into mathematical terms are beginning to allow us to define the relationship between mechanics and biochemistry at the molecular level and to attack the larger problem of biological complexity. Part I of this two-part article covers the evidence for cellular tensegrity at the molecular level and describes how this building system may provide a structural basis for the hierarchical organization of living systems — from molecule to organism. Part II, which focuses on how these structural networks influence information processing networks, appears in the next issue.},

	abstract = {How do molecules interact with each other? What happens if a neurotransmitter binds to a ligand-operated ion channel? How do antibodies recognize their antigens? Molecular recognition events play a pivotal role in nature: in enzymatic catalysis and during the replication and transcription of the genome; it is also important for the cohesion of cellular structures and in numerous metabolic reactions that molecules interact with each other in a specific manner. Conventional methods such as calorimetry provide very precise values of binding enthalpies; these are, however, average values obtained from a large ensemble of molecules without knowledge of the dynamics of the molecular recognition event. Which forces occur when a single molecular couple meets and forms a bond? Since the development of the scanning force microscope and force spectroscopy a couple of years ago, tools have now become available for measuring the forces between interfaces with high precision-starting from colloidal forces to the interaction of single molecules. The manipulation of individual molecules using force spectroscopy is also possible. In this way, the mechanical properties on a molecular scale are measurable. The study of single molecules is not an exclusive domain of force spectroscopy; it can also be performed with a surface force apparatus, laser tweezers, or the micropipette technique. Regardless of these techniques, force spectroscopy has been proven as an extraordinary versatile tool. The intention of this review article is to present a critical evaluation of the actual development of static force spectroscopy. The article mainly focuses on experiments dealing with inter- and intramolecular forces-starting with "simple" electrostatic forces, then ligand-receptor systems, and finally the stretching of individual molecules.},

Such systems are ubiquitous in the cytoskeleton and can be formed in vitro using filamentous actin and various cross-linkers. We find that their high-frequency rheology is characterized by a scaling behavior that is quite distinct from that of networks of the well-studied single semiflexible filaments. This regime can be understood theoretically in terms of a length-scale-dependent bending modulus for bundles. Next, we observe new dissipative dynamics associated with the shear-induced disruption of the network at intermediate frequencies. Finally, at low frequencies, we encounter a region of non-Newtonian rheology characterized by power-law scaling. This regime is dominated by bundle dissolution and large-scale rearrangements of the network driven by equilibrium thermal fluctuations.},

These microstructures are typically embedded into some viscous fluid and kept by stochastic thermal forces in an incessant motion, the so-called Brownian dynamics. In this article, we introduce a novel approach wherein three-dimensional finite beam elements can be employed for the computer simulation of the Brownian dynamics of rod-like microstructures. This new approach is superior to state-of-the-art methods by its transparent theoretical foundation and its remarkable efficiency.

	abstract = {The modern formulation of the renormalization group is explained for both critical phenomena in classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The expansion in ϵ = 4−d is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

	abstract = {Force-extension (F-x) relationships were measured for single molecules of DNA under a variety of buffer conditions, using an optical trapping interferometer modified to incorporate feedback control. One end of a single DNA molecule was fixed to a coverglass surface by means of a stalled RNA polymerase complex. The other end was linked to a microscopic bead, which was captured and held in an optical trap. The DNA was subsequently stretched by moving the coverglass with respect to the trap using a piezo-driven stage, while the position of the bead was recorded at nanometer-scale resolution. An electronic feedback circuit was activated to prevent bead movement beyond a preset clamping point by modulating the light intensity, altering the trap stiffness dynamically. This arrangement permits rapid determination of the F-x relationship for individual DNA molecules as short as -1 micron with unprecedented accuracy, subjected to both low (approximately 0.1 pN) and high (approximately 50 pN) loads: complete data sets are acquired in under a minute. Experimental F-x relationships were fit over much of their range by entropic elasticity theories based on worm-like chain models. Fits yielded a persistence length, Lp, of approximately 47 nm in a buffer containing 10 mM Na1. Multivalent cations, such as Mg2+ or spermidine 3+, reduced Lp to approximately 40 nm. Although multivalent ions shield most of the negative charges on the DNA backbone, they did not further reduce Lp significantly, suggesting that the intrinsic persistence length remains close to 40 nm. An elasticity theory incorporating both enthalpic and entropic contributions to stiffness fit the experimental results extremely well throughout the full range of extensions and returned an elastic modulus of approximately 1100 pN.},

Moreover, GIFT allows for the determination of particle charges and polydispersity indices. As test material, aqueous nanocrystalline cellulose suspensions (aNCS) prepared by the H2SO4 route have been investigated and characterized (SAXS, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential).},

Their approach has since been extended to other organs of the body, notably including the heart. The modern field of computational biology has expanded rapidly during the first decade of the twenty-first century and, through its contribution to what is now called systems biology, it is set to revise many of the fundamental principles of biology, including the relations between genotypes and phenotypes. Evolutionary theory, in particular, will require re-assessment. To succeed in this, computational and systems biology will need to develop the theoretical framework required to deal with multilevel interactions. While computational power is necessary, and is forthcoming, it is not sufficient. We will also require mathematical insight, perhaps of a nature we have not yet identified. This article is therefore also a challenge to mathematicians to develop such insights.},

	abstract = {We report a study of the microstructural templating role of incipient fibrin–thrombin gels by analysis of rheological and confocal microscope measurements. Fractal analysis based on the spectral dimension is used, for the first time, to characterise fibrin gel microstructure in terms of the internal connectivity of gel networks. A significant correlation is found between the fractal characteristics of the incipient gel network and its eventual mature form, confirming that incipient gel microstructure templates ensuing gel development. We report an analytical basis for the study of this templating effect which reveals two different regimes of microstructural development. The first involves low thrombin concentration, in which increasing concentration decreases the gel formation time and alters the fractal characteristics of both incipient and mature gels. In the second regime, involving higher thrombin concentrations, the incipient gel formation time and the fractal characteristics of incipient and mature gels show little variation. The network formation is discussed in terms of computer simulations of incipient fractal networks by the activation-limited aggregation of clusters of rod-like particles. The significance of the work is discussed in terms of biomaterials design for applications involving controlled drug release and wound healing, and improved predictions of blood clot susceptibility to lysis.},

	abstract = {Upon temperature changes, we observe a systematic shift of creep compliance curves J(t) for single living breast epithelial cells. We use a dual-beam laser trap (optical stretcher) to induce temperature jumps within milliseconds, while simultaneously measuring the mechanical response of whole cells to optical force. The cellular mechanical response was found to differ between sudden temperature changes compared to slow, long-term changes implying adaptation of cytoskeletal structure. Interpreting optically induced cell deformation as a thermorheological experiment allows us to consistently explain data on the basis of time–temperature superposition, well known from classical polymer physics. Measured time shift factors give access to the activation energy of the viscous flow of MCF-10A breast cells, which was determined to be ≈80 kJ mol−1. The presented measurements highlight the fundamental role that temperature plays for the deformability of cellular matter. We propose thermorheology as a powerful concept to assess the inherent material properties of living cells and to investigate cell regulatory responses upon environmental changes.},

	abstract = {The generation of robust periodic movements of complex nonlinear robotic systems is inherently difficult, especially, if parts of the robots are compliant. It has previously been proposed that complex nonlinear features of a robot, similarly as in biological organisms, might possibly facilitate its control. This bold hypothesis, commonly referred to as morphological computation, has recently received some theoretical support by Hauser et al. (Biol Cybern 105:355–370, doi:10.1007/s00422-012-0471-0, 2012). We show in this article that this theoretical support can be extended to cover not only the case of fading memory responses to external signals, but also the essential case of autonomous generation of adaptive periodic patterns, as, e.g., needed for locomotion. The theory predicts that feedback into the morphological computing system is necessary and sufficient for such tasks, for which a fading memory is insufficient. We demonstrate the viability of this theoretical analysis through computer simulations of complex nonlinear mass–spring systems that are trained to generate a large diversity of periodic movements by adapting the weights of a simple linear feedback device. Hence, the results of this article substantially enlarge the theoretically tractable application domain of morphological computation in robotics, and also provide new paradigms for understanding control principles of biological organisms.},

To calculate the power for detecting the between-treatment difference in the log scale, we need an estimate of the standard deviation of the log-transformed variable. However, in many situations a literature search only provides the arithmetic means and the corresponding standard deviations. Without individual log-transformed data to directly calculate the sample standard deviation, we need alternative methods to estimate it. This paper presents methods for estimating and constructing confidence intervals for the standard deviation of a log-transformed variable given the mean and standard deviation of the untransformed variable. It also presents methods for estimating the standard deviation of change from baseline in the log scale given the means and standard deviations of the untransformed baseline value, on-treatment value and change from baseline. Simulations and examples are provided to assess the performance of these estimates. Copyright 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00069-0},
	abstract = {Amorphous solids fall into any reasonable definition of a solid. This means that it should be possible to describe amorphous solids in terms of an expansion in deviations from a well defined rigid microscopic reference frame — as in the Cauchy-Born lattice-dynamics of periodic crystals. The continuum limit of this microscopic expansion is a field theory — continuum elasticity. It follows that different types of amorphous solids can differ from each other and from crystalline solids only because of differences in the nature of their microscopic reference states. A theory of amorphous solids which implements this general point of view must satisfy two very general restrictions: (1) translation-rotation invariance of the expansion and (2) the reference state must be a stable equilibrium state. We construct such a general theory and also describe some results of its application to specific types of amorphous solids. The monograph consists of three parts.

Part I. The Cauchy-Born Theory of Solids, describes a general and explicitly translation-rotation invariant formulation of the Cauchy-Born expansion. This is done by using the fact that the translation-rotation invariant energy of a many particle system can be regarded as a function of the interparticle distances. The resulting formalism leads to local expressions for the continuum limit which can be used to derive microscopic expressions for the local elastic constants and for the stresses from the coefficients in the microscopic expansion around a specific reference state. One finds that the initial stresses in the microscopic reference state lead to special stress induced terms in the harmonic expansion whose continuum limit is the second order strain. Their effect on the bulk stability of the reference states of tenuous solids is closely analogous to the role of stresses in continuum stability theory.

Part II. The Rigidity of Floppy Bonded Networks, studies the stability of tenuous reference states. The theory developed in this section extends the standard considerations of the effect of stresses on the elastic stability of thin rods and shells to the complex internal structures which describe the bulk of solids. There is a geometric aspect. The interaction scheme of a physical model, the bond structure, defines a graph — the bonded network. When this network can be deformed continuously in d-dimensions even when all its bonded distances are fixed is geometrically floppy. A model which is described by such a network has a manifold of free degrees of freedom which have no rigidity for unstressed reference states. Mostly the free modes describe collective deformations of the reference state. We show that their number can be very large and that they often constitute a significant fraction of all eigenmodes. Like the bending of a thin rod these free modes are sensitive to stresses in the reference state around which one is expanding. When there are stresses they can become unstable, leading to structural buckling instabilities, or stable — depending on the sign of the relevant stresses. The theory of floppy networks thus allows us to study structural buckling, the bulk analog of the Euler buckling of rods and shells, and the stabilization of bulk shears by stretching which is the origin of the shear rigidity of most soft solids.

Part III. The Role of Stresses in Amorphous Solids, applies these results. The emphasis is on the stability of the reference state. We require stability against structural buckling and on the role of stresses in stabilizing the soft modes of tenuous bonding structures. The shear rigidity of rubbers and wet gel-likes is that of floppy bonded networks which are stretched. Like the shear rigidity of stretched membranes it is that of a network of stretched springs. We show that this is possible only because such solids are not rigid down to the atomic level. We discuss the stability of stressed granular packings emphasizing the fact that the packing has to be stable against structural buckling. This gives considerable insight into the internal mechanics of granular packings because it not only considers the equilibrium conditions on the individual grains but also the collective linear stability of a stressed packing. We then describe a new model of quenched glasses which emphasizes the role of the internal stresses in the glass. The essence of this model is the distinction between the molecular configuration in the quenched liquid, the “snapshot state” and the stable equilibrium reference state of the glass which emerges from it even for the most rapid ideal quench. We argue that structural buckling dominates the restructuring in the ideal quench and show that this predicts strong correlations between the local structure of the reference state and the internal stresses. Some of the most striking properties of glasses appear naturally in this microscopic model.},

Motivated by recent experiments on active polymer gels, we present a simple model of percolation with a highly unusual phase transition that exhibits both a discontinuous jump in the order parameter as well as critical behavior characteristic of a continuous transition. We calculate the critical exponents of this model and demonstrate that the Fisher exponent, \${\textbackslash}tau\$, is smaller than the usual lower bound of \$2\$ in random percolation. This qualitatively changes the nature of the transition and leads to the unusual combination of first- and second-order signatures.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy is frequently used to study two and three dimensional network structures formed by cytoskeletal polymer fibers such as actin filaments and actin cables. While these cytoskeletal structures are often dilute enough to allow imaging of individual filaments or bundles of them, quantitative analysis of these images is challenging. To facilitate quantitative, reproducible and objective analysis of the image data, we propose a semi-automated method to extract actin networks and retrieve their topology in 3D. Our method uses multiple Stretching Open Active Contours (SOACs) that are automatically initialized at image intensity ridges and then evolve along the centerlines of filaments in the network. SOACs can merge, stop at junctions, and reconfigure with others to allow smooth crossing at junctions of filaments. The proposed approach is generally applicable to images of curvilinear networks with low SNR. We demonstrate its potential by extracting the centerlines of synthetic meshwork images, actin networks in 2D Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy images, and 3D actin cable meshworks of live fission yeast cells imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy. Quantitative evaluation of the method using synthetic images shows that for images with SNR above 5.0, the average vertex error measured by the distance between our result and ground truth is 1 voxel, and the average Hausdorff distance is below 10 voxels.},

In typical neuroimaging studies, multiple image registrations are performed, i.e., for atlas-based segmentation or template construction. Faster image registration routines would therefore be beneficial. In this paper we explore acceleration of the image registration package elastix by a combination of several techniques: (i) parallelization on the CPU, to speed up the cost function derivative calculation; (ii) parallelization on the GPU building on and extending the OpenCL framework from ITKv4, to speed up the Gaussian pyramid computation and the image resampling step; (iii) exploitation of certain properties of the B-spline transformation model; (iv) further software optimizations. The accelerated registration tool is employed in a study on diagnostic classification of Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls based on T1-weighted MRI. We selected 299 participants from the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Classification is performed with a support vector machine based on gray matter volumes as a marker for atrophy. We evaluated two types of strategies (voxel-wise and region-wise) that heavily rely on nonrigid image registration. Parallelization and optimization resulted in an acceleration factor of 4–5x on an 8-core machine. Using OpenCL a speedup factor of 2 was realized for computation of the Gaussian pyramids, and 15–60 for the resampling step, for larger images. The voxel-wise and the region-wise classification methods had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 88 and 90\%, respectively, both for standard and accelerated registration. We conclude that the image registration package elastix was substantially accelerated, with nearly identical results to the non-optimized version. The new functionality will become available in the next release of elastix as open source under the BSD license.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Automated three-dimensional {\textasciitilde}3-D! image analysis methods are presented for tracing of dye-injected neurons imaged by fluorescence confocal microscopy and HRP-stained neurons imaged by transmitted-light brightfield microscopy. An improved algorithm for adaptive 3-D skeletonization of noisy images enables the tracing. This algorithm operates by performing connectivity testing over large N � N � N voxel neighborhoods exploiting the sparseness of the structures of interest, robust surface detection that improves upon classical vacant neighbor schemes, improved handling of process ends or tips based on shape collapse prevention, and thickness-adaptive thinning. The confocal image stacks were skeletonized directly. The brightfield stacks required 3-D deconvolution. The results of skeletonization were analyzed to extract a graph representation. Topological and metric analyses can be carried out using this representation. A semiautomatic method was developed for reconnection of dendritic fragments that are disconnected due to insufficient dye penetration, an imaging deficiency, or skeletonization errors. Key words: automated neuron tracing, 3-D skeletonization, confocal microscopy, 3-D brightfield microscopy, deconvolution, reconnection},

The concepts of the conventional theory, mode-coupling, scaling, universality, and the renormalization group are introduced and are illustrated in the context of a simple example—the phase separation of a symmetric binary fluid. The renormalization group is then developed in some detail, and applied to a variety of systems. The main dynamic universality classes are identified and characterized. It is found that the mode-coupling and renormalization group theories successfully explain available experimental data at the critical point of pure fluids, and binary mixtures, and at many magnetic phase transitions, but that a number of discrepancies exist with data at the superfluid transition of He4{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mmultiscripts{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}He{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mprescripts{\textgreater}{\textless}/mprescripts{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}none{\textgreater}{\textless}/none{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}4{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}none{\textgreater}{\textless}/none{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}none{\textgreater}{\textless}/none{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mmultiscripts{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}.},

At the isostatic point, \$G\$ increases as the square-root of \$T\$, while we find \$G {\textbackslash}propto T{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ below the isostatic point, where \$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} {\textbackslash}simeq 0.8\$.

In vitro reconstitution of 'functional modules' of the cytoskeleton is now seen as a way of balancing the mutually conflicting demands for simplicity, which is required for systematic and quantitative studies, and for a sufficient degree of complexity that allows a faithful representation of biological functions.

Non-diffusive slow dynamics and aging in materials characterised by crowding of the constituents can be explained in terms of structural rearrangement or remodelling events that occur within the jammed state. In this context, we introduce the jamming phase diagram proposed by Liu and Nagel to understand the ergodic-nonergodic transition in these systems, and discuss recent theoretical attempts to explain the unusual, faster-than-exponential dynamical structure factors observed in jammed soft materials. We next focus on the anomalous rheology (flow and deformation behaviour) ubiquitous in soft matter characterised by metastability and structural disorder, and refer to the Soft Glassy Rheology (SGR) model that quantifies the mechanical response of these systems and predicts aging under suitable conditions. As part of a survey of experimental work related to these issues, we present x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) results of the aging of laponite clay suspensions following rejuvenation. We conclude by exploring the scientific literature for recent theoretical advances in the understanding of these models and for experimental investigations aimed at testing their predictions.},

	abstract = {The theory of critical phenomena in systems at equilibrium is reviewed at an introductory level with special emphasis on the values of the critical point exponents α, β, γ,..., and their interrelations. The experimental observations are surveyed and the analogies between different physical systems - fluids, magnets, superfluids, binary alloys, etc. - are developed phenomenologically. An exact theoretical basis for the analogies follows from the equivalence between classical and quantal `lattice gases' and the Ising and Heisenberg-Ising magnetic models. General rigorous inequalities for critical exponents at and below Tc are derived. The nature and validity of the `classical' (phenomenological and mean field) theories are discussed, their predictions being contrasted with the exact results for plane Ising models, which are summarized concisely. Padé approximant and ratio techniques applied to appropriate series expansions lead to precise critical-point estimates for the three-dimensional Heisenberg and Ising models (tables of data are presented). With this background a critique is presented of recent theoretical ideas: namely, the `droplet' picture of the critical point and the `homogeneity' and `scaling' hypotheses. These lead to a `law of corresponding states' near a critical point and to relations between the various exponents which suggest that perhaps only two or three exponents might be algebraically independent for any system.},

	abstract = {Biological as well as manmade materials with fibrous microstructures are ubiquitous in everyday life. At a certain length scale of observation, these materials appear in the form of a random network of cross-linked (connected) filaments. The computational effort required for investigating the mechanics of these structures by modeling the deformation of each fiber is very large. Therefore, a proper representation of their overall mechanical properties requires developing multiscale schemes capable of describing the behavior of the discrete system with a continuum model without loss of essential microstructural details. This article discusses two approaches developed for solving boundary value problems on large fiber-network domains using scale coupling techniques. We present first considerations related to sequential multiscale modeling, in particular linked to the scale of transition from a discrete to a continuum model of the network. Further, we review a method designed to construct a continuum model for the network structure, which takes into account the intrinsic spatial correlations of network properties. In both techniques, the geometrical and structural properties of network constituents at micro-scales are considered in estimating the macro-scale behavior of the structure subjected to external loads.},

Then, we use closed image edges to partition the binarized image that is generated using a high threshold, and obtain a primary binarization result by filling the partitioned high-threshold binary image with the seeds. Finally, the final binarization result is obtained by remedying the primary binarization result with the low-threshold binary image. Compared with the classical binarization methods and the similar binarization methods, our method is effective on the binarization of images with low contrast, noise and non-uniform illumination.},

The key difficulty in articulating this relationship is that shape is an inexhaustible parameter, making its systematic exploration infeasible. Here we show that the role of particle shape can, however, be explored efficiently when granular design is viewed in the context of artificial evolution. By introducing a mutable representation for particle shapes, we demonstrate with computer simulation how shapes can be evolved. As proof of principle, we predicted motifs that link shape to packing stiffness, discovered a particle that produces aggregates that stiffen—rather than weaken—under compression, and verified the results using three-dimensional printing. More generally, our approach facilitates the exploration of the role of arbitrary particle geometry in jammed systems, and invites the discovery and design of granular matter with optimized properties.},

The bead-spring and bead-rod models are presented, the range of their applicability discussed, and methods presented for inclusion of hydrodynamics interactions, excluded volume, and other physical effects within BD simulations. After reviewing and updating work in the linear viscoelastic regime, the primary focus shifts to the more complex nonlinear regime. While BD predictions of the conformations of 20 to 100 micron long DNA molecules in strong shear and extensional flows has been in good to excellent agreement with the corresponding experiments, predictions of the polystyrene dilute solutionrheometry data have been hit or miss, with poorer results obtained for the higher molecular weights. This may be due, in part, to the more important roles of hydrodynamic interactions and excluded volume interactions in the more flexible, and therefore more condensed, polystyrene coils. Inclusion of these effects in BD simulations has led to improved predictions, but does not lead to the accurate prediction of the plateau Trouton viscosity for higher molecular weight samples, nor alleviate the complete failure of simulations to predict measurements of coil distortion by light scattering. Thus, despite enormous progress in the past decade, some significant gaps in understanding remain.},

The mechanical and mass transport properties and the microstructure of the differently set gels were characterized by rheological measurements, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images show a zone of distorted anisotropic gel structure in the vicinity of the capillaries as well as indications of a lower degree of void connectivity. The diffusion rates of dextran at large distances from the capillaries were fast and capillary gels showed a plastic behaviour in comparison to the internally set gels. The results presented show large functional differences between the internally and externally set gels, which cannot be explained by the presence of capillaries alone.},

	abstract = {Understanding the chemistry and physics of polymer systems challenges scientists from a wide spectrum of research areas, ranging from polymer science to molecular electronic structure theory. One of the characteristic features of polymer systems is that their physics involve a multitude of different length and time scales, which generally render the determination of their structure and physical properties on a detailed level computationally exhaustive. To overcome this difficulty, novel field-theoretic methodologies based on the mean field approximation have emerged recently and have proven to deliver useful results in the calculation of mesoscopic polymer models in the regime of high monomer concentrations. In this review we demonstrate that the field-theoretic approach is not only an useful formalism for treating highly concentrated polymer systems on the mesoscopic level of description, but that it is also a promising theoretical tool, to solve the multiscale problems arising in the calculation of physical properties of a wide variety of neutral and charged polymer materials. To this end, we show that the field-theoretic approach possesses the advantageous property to enable the treatment of all levels of description, spanning from the quantum to the continuum scale, within an unified theoretical framework. On the example of the coupling of the mesoscopic and continuum scale, we show that this specific feature constitutes a crucial advantage of field-theoretic approaches with regard to current state-of-the-art particle-based simulation methodologies for connecting different levels of description. Another major benefit relates to their favorable approximation characteristics, which permit to devise efficient approximation strategies for evaluating sophisticated polymer solution models in the low to moderate regime of monomer concentrations in a reliable way. To show this, we present novel low-cost approximation strategies beyond the mean field level of approximation using effective renormalization concepts, originating from the domain of quantum field theory, and demonstrate their usefulness in the calculation of structure and physical properties of several polymer models, described at various levels of description.},

Our model system consists of short bead-spring chains and the temperature ranges from well above the glass transition temperature to about 10\% above it. The nano-particle clearly couples to the slowing down of the polymer segments and the calculated storage and loss moduli reveal the approach to the glass transition. At temperatures close to the mode coupling T c of the polymer melt, the micro-rheological moduli measure the local viscoelastic response of the cage of monomers surrounding the nano-particle and no longer reveal the true melt moduli. The incoherent scattering function of the nano-particle exhibits a stretched exponential decay, typical for the α-process in glass forming systems. We find no indication of a strong superdiffusive regime as has been deduced from a recent experiment in the same temperature range but for smaller momentum transfers.},

In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications.},

Dextran filaments linked to a gold surface were probed with the atomic force microscope tip by vertical stretching. At low forces the deformation of dextran was found to be dominated by entropic forces and can be described by the Langevin function with a 6 angstrom Kuhn length. At elevated forces the strand elongation was governed by a twist of bond angles. At higher forces the dextran filaments underwent a distinct conformational change. The polymer stiffened and the segment elasticity was dominated by the bending of bond angles. The conformational change was found to be reversible and was corroborated by molecular dynamics calculations.},

	abstract = {Applications for porous fibrous materials range from electrochemical substrates to web reinforcement in polymeric composite materials. The details of local load transfer are studied in a class of cost-effective, stochastic fibrous networks used in battery applications, which form the substrate for a composite electrode. The connectivity of these materials is quantitatively related to modulus and strength, and detailed results of different simulations approaches in approximating material construction are discussed. In Part I, we discuss microscale assumptions, including beam type, nodal connections and equivalence of models to more physically realistic models. Simulation of large networks is computationally intensive, and show low-strain, nonlinear behavior even when comprised of elastic elements when failure criteria (here, strength-of-materials) are applied to produce sequential rupture of beams and nodes. Strategies for effective simulation of these materials requires detailed analysis of the simplest assumptions which can be made at the microscale which produce acceptably realistic response. We show that simple Euler-Bernoulli beam elements can be used to effectively model such materials, even when segment lengths in a network are very small. Moreover, connections comprised of simple torsion springs produce realistic behavior, and can mimic more realistic junctures by adaptation of the linear solution to a compliant zone model. In Part II of this work, we demonstrate the effect of model selection on full network behavior, and also discuss issues of connectivity at the scale of the porous material rather than element-by-element. This work points toward use of simple constructions to model complex behavior, and may ultimately provide insight into modeling of a large class of porous materials. [S0094-4289(00)01704-7]},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock–paper–scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.},

The first three sections give a relatively short review of basic renormalization group ideas, mainly in the context of critical phenomena. The relationship of the modern renormalization group to the older problems of divergences in statistical mechanics and field theory and field theoretic renormalization is discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V the special case of "marginal variables" is discussed in detail, along with the relationship of the modern renormalization group to its original formulation by Gell-Mann and Low and others.},

	abstract = {The challenges faced in analyzing optical imaging data from neurons include a low signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired images and the multiscale nature of the tubular structures that range in size from hundreds of microns to hundreds of nanometers. In this paper, we address these challenges and present a computational framework for an automatic, three-dimensional (3D) morphological reconstruction of live nerve cells. The key aspects of this approach are: (i) detection of neuronal dendrites through learning 3D tubular models, and (ii) skeletonization by a new algorithm using a morphology-guided deformable model for extracting the dendritic centerline. To represent the neuron morphology, we introduce a novel representation, the Minimum Shape-Cost (MSC) Tree that approximates the dendrite centerline with sub-voxel accuracy and demonstrate the uniqueness of such a shape representation as well as its computational efficiency. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative results that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method.},

	abstract = {We present a study of exclusion processes on networks as models for complex transport phenomena, and in particular for active transport of motor proteins along the cytoskeleton. Specifically, we focus on the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) as well as its generalizations including backstepping (partially asymmetric simple exclusion process (PASEP)) and exchange with a bulk concentration (TASEP with Langmuir kinetics (TASEP-LK)). We build on the previously used effective rate approach to establish a general methodology in terms of effective rate diagrams, which allows for a simple classification of the stationary transport state of the total network. This approach is general and reveals generic features of exclusion processes on networks. Based on the three examples considered here, we show that the classification can be made in terms of three qualitative different network regimes: a homogeneous regime, a heterogeneous network regime and a heterogeneous segment regime. Using parameters representative of real motor proteins, we show how the transitions between these regimes can be regulated through a variety of multi-scale factors, such as the interplay of exclusion interactions, the non-equilibrium nature of the transport process, motor processivity and the network topology. Using the equilibrium limits of PASEP and TASEP-LK, we also shed further light on the emergence of density heterogeneities in active transport phenomena.},

	abstract = {The skeleton is essential for general shape representation. The commonly required properties of a skeletonization algorithm are that the extracted skeleton should be accurate; robust to noise, position and rotation; able to reconstruct the original object; and able to produce a connected skeleton in order to preserve its topological and hierarchical properties. However, the use of a discrete image presents a lot of problems that may influence the extraction of the skeleton. Moreover, most of the methods are memory-intensive and computationally intensive, and require a complex data structure.

In this paper, we propose a fast, efficient and accurate skeletonization method for the extraction of a well-connected Euclidean skeleton based on a signed sequential Euclidean distance map. A connectivity criterion is proposed, which can be used to determine whether a given pixel is a skeleton point independently. The criterion is based on a set of point pairs along the object boundary, which are the nearest contour points to the pixel under consideration and its 8 neighbors. Our proposed method generates a connected Euclidean skeleton with a single pixel width without requiring a linking algorithm or iteration process. Experiments show that the runtime of our algorithm is faster than the distance transformation and is linearly proportional to the number of pixels of an image.},

Specifically, using these approaches, we compute equilibrium probability distributions at constant temperature as well as velocity autocorrelation functions of the nanocarrier subject to thermal motion in a quiescent Newtonian fluid medium, when tethered by a harmonic spring force mimicking a tether due to a single receptor–ligand bond. We demonstrate that the thermal equipartition of translation, rotation, and spring degrees of freedom are preserved by our formalism while simultaneously resolving the nature of the hydrodynamic correlations. Additionally, we evaluate the potential of mean force (or free energy density) along a specified reaction coordinate to facilitate extensive conformational sampling of the nanocarrier motion. We show that our results are in excellent agreement with analytical results and Monte Carlo simulations, thereby validating our methodologies. The frameworks we have presented provide a comprehensive platform for temporal multiscale modeling of hydrodynamic and microscopic interactions mediating nanocarrier motion and adhesion in vascular targeted drug delivery.},

The important role played by computer simulations in studying and understanding the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is given. The recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics is reviewed. The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, an extensive overview is given of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Non-relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated here in a different way. It is, however, mathematically equivalent to the familiar formulation. In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions, one from each alternative way. The probability that a particle will be found to have a path x(t) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of ℏ) for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching x, t from the past is the wave function ψ(x, t). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated, in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics.},

	abstract = {A goal of complex system research is to identify the dynamical implications of network structure. While early results focused mainly on local or global structural properties, there is now growing interest in mesoscale structures that comprise more than one node but not the whole network. A central challenge is to discover under what conditions the occurrence of a specific mesoscale motif already allows conclusions on the dynamics of a network as a whole. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of ecological food webs, complex heterogeneous networks of interacting populations. Generalizing the results of MacArthur and Sánchez-García (2009 Phys. Rev. E 80 26117), we show that certain mesoscale symmetries imply the existence of localized dynamical modes. If these modes are unstable the occurrence of the corresponding mesoscale motif implies dynamical instability regardless of the structure of the embedding network. In contrast, if the mode is stable it means that the symmetry can be exploited to reduce the number of nodes in the model, without changing the dynamics of the system. This result explains a previously observed dynamical equivalence between food webs containing a different number of species.},

One such open puzzle is the observed pulses of backward-moving myosin-X in the filopodia structure. Motivated by this phenomenon we introduce two generalizations of the ‘total asymmetric exclusion process’ (TASEP) that might be relevant to the formation of such pulses. The first is adding a nearest-neighbours attractive interaction between motors, while the second is adding an internal degree of freedom corresponding to a processive and immobile form of the motors. Switching between the two states occurs stochastically, without a conservation law. Both models show strong deviations from the mean field behaviour and lack particle–hole symmetry. We use approximations borrowed from the research on vehicular traffic models to calculate the current and jam size distribution in a system with periodic boundary conditions and introduce a novel modification to one of these approximation schemes.},

	abstract = {The shapes of eukaryotic cells and ultimately the organisms that they form are defined by cycles of mechanosensing, mechanotransduction and mechanoresponse. Local sensing of force or geometry is transduced into biochemical signals that result in cell responses even for complex mechanical parameters such as substrate rigidity and cell-level form. These responses regulate cell growth, differentiation, shape changes and cell death. Recent tissue scaffolds that have been engineered at the micro- and nanoscale level now enable better dissection of the mechanosensing, transduction and response mechanisms.},

In order to study the conformational changes of these proteins, a one-bead-per-amino-acid coarse grained (CG) model is developed, and a method is proposed to extract the potential functions for the local interactions between CG beads. Experimentally obtained Ramachandran data for the coil regions of proteins are converted into distributions of pseudo-bond and pseudo-dihedral angles between neighboring alpha-carbons in the polypeptide chain. These are then used to derive bending and torsion potentials, which are residue and sequence specific. The validity of the developed model is testified by studying the radius of gyration as well as the hydrodynamic properties of chemically denatured proteins.},

It was ascertained that two the length scales that characterize the gel network (diameter of polymer chain and typical mesh size of the gel network) can be determined quantitatively by a 3-d box-counting analysis and a 3-d Fourier transform (FT) analysis to obtain the power spectra. Turbidity measurements were employed for the determination of average fiber diameter. Self-similar structure of the gel network was found to be realized in the range between those two scales. The fibrin gels formed by larger amounts of thrombin showed a smaller fractal dimension that, deduced by the box-counting method, was in good agreement with the result from 3-d FT analysis and with a recent dynamic light scattering study (Kita R. et al.

	abstract = {The microstructure of tissues and tissue equivalents (TEs) plays a critical role in determining the mechanical properties thereof. One of the key challenges in constitutive modeling of TEs is incorporating the kinematics at both the macroscopic and the microscopic scale. Models of fibrous microstructure commonly assume fibrils to move homogeneously, that is affine with the macroscopic deformation. While intuitive for situations of fibril-matrix load transfer, the relevance of the affine assumption is less clear when primary load transfer is from fibril to fibril. The microstructure of TEs is a hydrated network of collagen fibrils, making its microstructural kinematics an open question. Numerical simulation of uniaxial extensile behavior in planar TE networks was performed with fibril kinematics dictated by the network model and by the affine model. The average fibril orientation evolved similarly with strain for both models. The individual fibril kinematics, however, were markedly different. There was no correlation between fibril strain and orientation in the network model, and fibril strains were contained by extensive reorientation. As a result, the macroscopic stress given by the network model was roughly threefold lower than the affine model. Also, the network model showed a toe region, where fibril reorientation precluded the development of significant fibril strain. We conclude that network fibril kinematics are not governed by affine principles, an important consideration in the understanding of tissue and TE mechanics, especially when load bearing is primarily by an interconnected fibril network.},

	abstract = {Collagen is the most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM), where its structural organization conveys mechanical information to cells. Using optical-tweezers-based microrheology, we investigated mechanical properties both of collagen molecules at a range of concentrations in acidic solution where fibrils cannot form and of gels of collagen fibrils formed at neutral pH, as well as the development of microscale mechanical heterogeneity during the self-assembly process. The frequency scaling of the complex shear modulus even at frequencies of ∼10 kHz was not able to resolve the flexibility of collagen molecules in acidic solution. In these solutions, molecular interactions cause significant transient elasticity, as we observed for 5 mg/ml solutions at frequencies above ∼200 Hz. We found the viscoelasticity of solutions of collagen molecules to be spatially homogeneous, in sharp contrast to the heterogeneity of self-assembled fibrillar collagen systems, whose elasticity varied by more than an order of magnitude and in power-law behavior at different locations within the sample. By probing changes in the complex shear modulus over 100-minute timescales as collagen self-assembled into fibrils, we conclude that microscale heterogeneity appears during early phases of fibrillar growth and continues to develop further during this growth phase. Experiments in which growing fibrils dislodge microspheres from an optical trap suggest that fibril growth is a force-generating process. These data contribute to understanding how heterogeneities develop during self-assembly, which in turn can help synthesis of new materials for cellular engineering.},

We demonstrate that the growth of the structures depends on the intricate balance between crosslinker-induced stabilization and simultaneous destabilization by molecular motors, a mechanism analogous to nucleation and growth in passive systems. We also show that the intricate interplay between force generation, coarsening and connectivity is responsible for the highly dynamic process of structure formation in this heterogeneous active gel, and that these competing mechanisms result in anomalous transport, reminiscent of intracellular dynamics.},

Part I of this two-part article, described a mechanical model of cell structure based on tensegrity architecture that explains how the mechanical behavior of the cell emerges from physical interactions among the different molecular filament systems that form the cytoskeleton. Recent work shows that the cytoskeleton also orients much of the cell's metabolic and signal transduction machinery and that mechanical distortion of cells and the cytoskeleton through cell surface integrin receptors can profoundly affect cell behavior. In particular, gradual variations in this single physical control parameter (cell shape distortion) can switch cells between distinct gene programs (e.g. growth, differentiation and apoptosis), and this process can be viewed as a biological phase transition. Part II of this article covers how combined use of tensegrity and solid-state mechanochemistry by cells may mediate mechanotransduction and facilitate integration of chemical and physical signals that are responsible for control of cell behavior. In addition, it examines how cell structural networks affect gene and protein signaling networks to produce characteristic phenotypes and cell fate transitions during tissue development.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we compare the interactions between low methoxy pectin (LMP) and either Ca2+ or Zn2+ in semi-dilute solutions. Intrinsic viscosity and turbidity measurements reveal that pectin–calcium solutions are more viscous, but yet less turbid, than pectin–zinc ones. To get a molecular understanding of the origin of this rather unexpected behavior, we further performed isothermal titration calorimetry, small angle neutron scattering experiments, as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Our results suggest that calcium cations induce the formation of a more homogeneous network of pectin than zinc cations do. The molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this difference could originate from the way the two cations bind to the galacturonate unit (Gal), the main component of LMP: zinc interacts with both carboxylate and hydroxyl groups of Gal, in a similar way to that described in the so-called egg-box model, whereas calcium only interacts with carboxylate groups. This different binding behavior seems to arise from the stronger interaction of water molecules with zinc than with calcium. Accordingly, galacturonate chains are more loosely associated with each other in the presence of Ca2+ than with Zn2+. This may improve their ability to form a gel, not only by dimerization, but also by the formation of point-like cross-links. Overall, our results show that zinc binds less easily to pectin than calcium does.},

	abstract = {Network formation of associative semiflexible fibers and mixtures of fibers and colloidal particles is simulated for the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model of elastic contacts, and a phase diagram in terms of particle elasticity and surface energy is presented. When fibers self-assemble, they form a network for sufficiently large fiber-solvent surface energy. If the surface energy is above the value where single particles crystallize, the adhesion forces drive diffusion-limited aggregation. Two mechanisms contribute to coarsening: non-associated chains joining existing bundles, and fiber bundles merging. Coarsening stops when the length of the network connections is roughly the persistence length, independent of surface energy. If the surface energy is below the value where single particles crystallize, a network can still be formed but at a much slower (reaction limited) rate. Loose (liquid-like) assemblies between chains form when they happen to run more-or-less parallel. These assemblies grow by diffusion and aggregation and form a loose network, which sets in micro-phase separation, i.e., syneresis. Only when the clusters crystallize, the coarsening process stops. In this case, the length of the network connections is larger than the persistence length of a single chain, and depends on the value of the surface energy. All networks of semiflexible homopolymers in this study show syneresis. Mixtures of fibers and colloid particles also form fiber bundle networks, but by choosing the colloid volume fraction sufficiently low, swelling gels are obtained. Applications of this model are in biological systems where fibers self-assemble into cell walls and bone tissue.},

	abstract = {Frustrated, out-of-equilibrium materials have been of considerable interest for some time and continue to be some of the least understood materials. Recent measurements have shown that many gelled biopolymer materials display slow dynamics on timescales greater than one second, that are not accessible with typical methods, and are characteristic of glassy trapped systems. In this study we have controlled the fine structure of the anionic polysaccharide pectin in order to construct a series of ionotropic gels having differing binding energies between the constituent chains, in an attempt to further understand the slow dynamical processes occurring. Using multi-speckle light scattering techniques it is shown that the slow dynamics observed in these gelled systems are stress-driven. As the binding lengths, and thus the binding energies, of the junction zones between the polymer chains in these networks increase the long-time dynamics initially slow, as might be expected, until a critical level of internal stress is reached upon which the dynamics increase significantly, with gentle creaking punctuated by localised stress-relieving quakes.},

	abstract = {Stiff polymers, such as single-stranded DNA, unstructured RNA and cellulose, are all basically extremely long rods with relatively short repeating monomers. The simplest model for describing such stiff polymers is called the freely jointed chain model, which treats a molecule as a chain of perfectly rigid subunits of orientationally independent statistical segments, joined together by perfectly flexible hinges. A more realistic model that incorporates the entropic elasticity of a molecule, called the worm-like chain model, has been proposed by assuming that each monomer resists the bending force. Some force-extension formulae for the worm-like chain model have been previously found in terms of interpolation and numerical solutions resulting from statistical mechanics. In this paper, however, we adopt a variational principle to seek the minimum energy configuration of a stretched molecule by incorporating all the possible orientations of each monomer under thermal equilibrium, i.e., constant temperature. We determine a force-extension formula for the worm-like chain model analytically. We find that our formula suggests new terms such as the free energy and the cut-off force of a molecule, which define a clear transition from the entropic regime to the enthalpic regime and the fracture of the molecule, respectively. In addition, we predict two possible phase changes for a stretched molecule, i.e., from a super-helix to a soliton and then from a soliton to a vertical twisted line. We show theoretically that a molecule must undergo at least one phase change before it is fully stretched into its total contour length. This new formula is used to fit recent experimental data and shows a good agreement with some current literature that uses a statistical approach. Finally, an instability analysis is adopted to investigate the sensitivity of the new formula subject to small changes in temperature.},

great challenge, with an impact that ranges from industrial applications to fundamental
issues in modern statistical physics, such as the glass transition and the description of
out-of-equilibrium systems. Although our understanding of these phenomena is still far
from complete, recent simulations and novel theoretical approaches and experimental
methods have shed new light on the dynamics of soft glassy materials. In this paper,
we review the work of the last few years, with an emphasis on experiments in four
distinct and yet related areas: the existence of two different glass states (attractive
and repulsive), the dynamics of systems very far from equilibrium, the effect of an
external perturbation on glassy materials, and dynamical heterogeneity.},

Such geometries therefore represent a deformed configuration stressed by typical in vivo conditions. Commonly, such structures are considered stress free in simulation. In this contribution we present and compare two methods to introduce a physically meaningful stress/strain state to the obtained geometry for simulations in the finite strain regime and demonstrate the necessity of such prestressing techniques. One method is based on an inverse design analysis to calculate a stress-free reference configuration. The other method developed here is based on a modified updated Lagrangian formulation. The formulation of both methods is provided in detail and implementation issues are discussed. Applicability and accurateness of both approaches are compared and evaluated utilizing an analytical aorta model and fully three-dimensional patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm structures in the finite strain regime.

This structural contribution was determined from the relationships between the global viscoelastic properties of the tensegrity model, i.e., normalized viscosity modulus (η*), normalized elasticity modulus (E*), and the physical properties of the constitutive elements, i.e., their normalized length (L*) and normalized initial internal tension (T*). We used a numerical method to simulate the deformation of the structure in response to different types of loading, while varying by several orders of magnitude L* and T*. The numerical results obtained reveal that η* remains almost independent of changes in T* (η*∝T*+0.1), whereas E* increases with approximately the square root of the internal tension T* (from E*∝T*+0.3 to E*∝T*+0.7). Moreover, structural viscosity η* and elasticity E* are both inversely proportional to the square of the size of the structure (η*∝L*−2 and E*∝L*−2). These structural properties appear consistent with cytoskeleton (CSK) mechanical properties measured experimentally by various methods which are specific to the CSK micromanipulation in living adherent cells. Present results suggest, for the first time, that the effect of structural rearrangement of CSK elements on global CSK behavior is characterized by a faster cellular mechanical response relatively to the CSK element response, which thus contributes to the solidification process observed in adherent cells. In extending to the viscoelastic properties the analysis of the mechanical response of the cellular 30-element tensegrity model, the present study contributes to the understanding of recent results on the cellular-dynamic response and allows to reunify the scattered data reported for the viscoelastic properties of living adherent cells.},

With the remarkable increase in the volume imaged by, and resolution of, modern day 3D imagers, it is almost impossible to make manual tracking of the complex multiscale parameters from those large image data sets. In addition, the manual tracking is quite subjective and unreliable.

	abstract = {Mechanical force plays an important role in the physiology of eukaryotic cells whose dominant structural constituent is the actin cytoskeleton composed mainly of actin and actin crosslinking proteins (ACPs). Thus, knowledge of rheological properties of actin networks is crucial for understanding the mechanics and processes of cells. We used Brownian dynamics simulations to study the viscoelasticity of crosslinked actin networks. Two methods were employed, bulk rheology and segment-tracking rheology, where the former measures the stress in response to an applied shear strain, and the latter analyzes thermal fluctuations of individual actin segments of the network. It was demonstrated that the storage shear modulus (G′) increases more by the addition of ACPs that form orthogonal crosslinks than by those that form parallel bundles. In networks with orthogonal crosslinks, as crosslink density increases, the power law exponent of G′ as a function of the oscillation frequency decreases from 0.75, which reflects the transverse thermal motion of actin filaments, to near zero at low frequency. Under increasing prestrain, the network becomes more elastic, and three regimes of behavior are observed, each dominated by different mechanisms: bending of actin filaments, bending of ACPs, and at the highest prestrain tested (55\%), stretching of actin filaments and ACPs. In the last case, only a small portion of actin filaments connected via highly stressed ACPs support the strain. We thus introduce the concept of a ‘supportive framework,’ as a subset of the full network, which is responsible for high elasticity. Notably, entropic effects due to thermal fluctuations appear to be important only at relatively low prestrains and when the average crosslinking distance is comparable to or greater than the persistence length of the filament. Taken together, our results suggest that viscoelasticity of the actin network is attributable to different mechanisms depending on the amount of prestrain., The actin cytoskeleton provides structural integrity to a cell, is highly dynamic, and plays a central role in a wide variety of phenomena such as migration and the sensation of external forces. For years, researchers have studied the mechanics of the cytoskeleton by creating actin gels in the laboratory in combination with proteins that bridge between and reinforce the actin gel found inside cells. These gels, however, failed to replicate many aspects of cell behavior. Recent studies have shown that tension within the cytoskeleton contributes to the observed stiffness of cells. Still, our understanding of cytoskeletal mechanics is incomplete, and many observed phenomena cannot be explained by existing models. Here, we simulate a three-dimensional network containing actin filaments linked together by other proteins. We studied the relative contributions of thermal fluctuations of the network and the stiffness of filaments and linking proteins. Under conditions that replicate those in a cell, properties of the linking proteins are surprisingly significant, as is the stiffness of the actin filament to stretching. Thermal fluctuations are relatively unimportant, but become more so at low levels of resting tension. At high tensions, a small fraction of filaments support a majority of the load.},

	abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

These networks exhibit a rich set of remarkable mechanical properties, but a detailed picture relating the microscopic mechanics of the individual fibers to the overall network properties has not been fully developed. In particular, how the high strain and failure characteristics of single fibers affect the overall strength of the network is not known. Using a combined fluorescence/atomic force microscope nanomanipulation system, we stretched 2-D fibrin networks to the point of failure, while recording the strain of individual fibers. Our results were compared to a pair of model networks: one composed of linearly responding elements and a second of nonlinear, strain-stiffening elements. We find that strain-stiffening of the individual fibers is necessary to explain the pattern of strain propagation throughout the network that we observe in our experiments. Fiber strain-stiffening acts to distribute strain more equitably within the network, reduce strain maxima, and increase network strength. Along with its physiological implications, a detailed understanding of this strengthening mechanism may lead to new design strategies for engineered polymeric materials.},

	abstract = {Amorphous glassy materials of diverse nature—concentrated emulsions, granular materials, pastes, molecular glasses—display complex flow properties, intermediate between solid and liquid, which are at the root of their use in many applications. A general feature of such systems, well documented yet not really understood, is the strongly nonlinear nature of the flow rule relating stresses and strain rates. Here we use a microfluidic velocimetry technique to characterize the flow of thin layers of concentrated emulsions, confined in gaps of different thicknesses by surfaces of different roughnesses. We find evidence for finite-size effects in the flow behaviour and the absence of an intrinsic local flow rule. In contrast to the classical nonlinearities of the rheological behaviour of amorphous materials, we show that a rather simple non-local flow rule can account for all the velocity profiles. This non-locality of the dynamics is quantified by a length, characteristic of cooperativity within the flow at these scales, that is unobservable in the liquid state (lower emulsion concentrations) and that increases with concentration in the jammed state. Beyond its practical importance for applications involving thin layers (for example, coatings), these non-locality and cooperativity effects have parallels in the behaviour of other glassy, jammed and granular systems, suggesting a possible fundamental universality.},
